If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + half caster level for a nonspell effect.) If you concentrate on a specific creature within 120 feet of you as a standard action, you can determine whether it has any spellcasting or spell-like abilities, whether these are arcane or divine (spell-like abilities register as arcane), and the strength of the most powerful spell or spell-like ability the creature currently has available for use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with &lt;i&gt;detect magic&lt;/i&gt;, you can use this spell to identify the properties of magic items, but not artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Arcane sight&lt;/i&gt; can be made permanent with a &lt;i&gt;permanency&lt;/i&gt; spell.&lt;/p&gt;",PFRPG Core,,Magical auras become visible to you.,NULL

You can bring the astral forms of other willing creatures with you, provided that these subjects are linked in a circle with you at the time of the casting. These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you at all times. If something happens to you during the journey, your companions are stranded wherever you left them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You project your astral self onto the Astral Plane, leaving your physical body behind on the Material Plane in a state of suspended animation. The spell projects an astral copy of you and all you wear or carry onto the Astral Plane. Since the Astral Plane touches upon other planes, you can travel astrally to any of these other planes as you will. To enter one, you leave the Astral Plane, forming a new physical body (and equipment) on the plane of existence you have chosen to enter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you are on the Astral Plane, your astral body is connected at all times to your physical body by an incorporeal silver cord. If the cord is broken, you are killed, astrally and physically. Luckily, very few things can destroy a silver cord. When a second body is formed on a different plane, the silver cord remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the second body or the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to your body where it rests on the Material Plane, thereby reviving it from its state of suspended animation. This is a traumatic affair, however, and you gain two permanent negative levels if your second body or astral form is slain. Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral Plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral Plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You and your companions may travel through the Astral Plane indefinitely. Your bodies simply wait behind in a state of suspended animation until you choose to return your spirits to them. The spell lasts until you desire to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as &lt;i&gt;dispel magic&lt;/i&gt; cast upon either the physical body or the astral form, the breaking of the silver cord, or the destruction of your body back on the Material Plane (which kills you).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When this spell ends, your astral body and all of its gear, vanishes.&lt;/p&gt;",PFRPG Core,Travel (9),Projects you and others onto Astral Plane.,1000

The creature seeking atonement must be truly repentant and desirous of setting right its misdeeds. If the atoning creature committed the evil act unwittingly or under some form of compulsion, &lt;i&gt;atonement&lt;/i&gt; operates normally at no cost to you. However, in the case of a creature atoning for deliberate misdeeds, you must intercede with your deity (requiring you to expend 2,500 gp in rare incense and offerings). &lt;i&gt;Atonement&lt;/i&gt; may be cast for one of several purposes, depending on the version selected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reverse Magical Alignment Change&lt;/i&gt;: If a creature has had its alignment magically changed, atonement returns its alignment to its original status at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Restore Class&lt;/i&gt;: A paladin, or other class, who has lost her class features due to violating the alignment restrictions of her class may have her class features restored by this spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Restore Cleric or Druid Spell Powers&lt;/i&gt;: A cleric or druid who has lost the ability to cast spells by incurring the anger of her deity may regain that ability by seeking &lt;i&gt;atonement&lt;/i&gt; from another cleric of the same deity or another druid.

The prospective subject must be present for the entire casting process. Upon completion of the spell, the subject freely chooses whether it retains its original alignment or acquiesces to your offer and changes to your alignment. No duress, compulsion, or magical influence can force the subject to take advantage of the opportunity offered if it is unwilling to abandon its old alignment. This use of the spell does not work on outsiders or any creature incapable of changing its alignment naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the spell descriptionrefers to evil acts, &lt;i&gt;atonement&lt;/i&gt; can be used on any creature that has performed acts against its alignment, regardless of the actual alignment in question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: Normally, changing alignment is up to the player.

A question may be so straightforward that a successful result is automatic, or so vague as to have no chance of success.

The target gets an initial saving throw only if its Hit Dice equal at least half your caster level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may have as many as six assistants help you with the spell. For each assistant who casts &lt;i&gt;suggestion&lt;/i&gt;, your caster level for this casting of &lt;i&gt;binding&lt;/i&gt; increases by 1. For each assistant who casts &lt;i&gt;dominate animal&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;dominate person&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;dominate monster&lt;/i&gt;, your caster level for this casting of binding increases by a number equal to a third of that assistant&apos;s level, provided that the spell&apos;s target is appropriate for a &lt;i&gt;binding&lt;/i&gt; spell. Since the assistants&apos; spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the &lt;i&gt;binding&lt;/i&gt; spell, saving throws and spell resistance against the assistants&apos; spells are irrelevant. Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial Will saving throw and how long the &lt;i&gt;binding&lt;/i&gt; lasts. All &lt;i&gt;binding&lt;/i&gt; spells are dismissible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the version of &lt;i&gt;binding&lt;/i&gt; you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur. These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the condition must be reasonable and have a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature&apos;s name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don&apos;t qualify. Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed. Setting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you cast any of the first three versions of &lt;i&gt;binding&lt;/i&gt; (those with limited durations), you may cast additional &lt;i&gt;binding&lt;/i&gt; spells to prolong the effect, overlapping the durations. If you do so, the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell&apos;s duration, even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw. If the creature&apos;s save succeeds, all &lt;i&gt;binding&lt;/i&gt; spells it has received are broken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;binding&lt;/i&gt; spell has six versions. Choose one of the following versions when you cast the spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chaining&lt;/i&gt;: The subject is confined by restraints that generate an &lt;i&gt;antipathy&lt;/i&gt; spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you. The duration is 1 year per caster level. The subject of this form of &lt;i&gt;binding&lt;/i&gt; is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell. Casting this version requires a chain that is long enough to wrap around the creature three times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Slumber&lt;/i&gt;: This version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as 1 year per caster level. The subject does not need to eat or drink while slumbering, nor does it age. This form of &lt;i&gt;binding&lt;/i&gt; is slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell&apos;s save DC by 1. Casting this version requires a jar of sand or rose petals. This is a &lt;i&gt;sleep&lt;/i&gt; effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bound Slumber&lt;/i&gt;: This combination of chaining and slumber lasts for as long as 1 month per caster level. Reduce the save DC by 2. Casting this version requires both a long chain and a jar of sand or rose petals. This is a &lt;i&gt;sleep&lt;/i&gt; effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hedged Prison&lt;/i&gt;: The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area from which it cannot wander by any means. This effect is permanent. Reduce the save DC by 3. Casting this version requires a tiny golden cage worth 100 gp that is consumed when the spell is cast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Metamorphosis&lt;/i&gt;: The subject assumes &lt;i&gt;gaseous form&lt;/i&gt;, except for its head or face. It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose. The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. The &lt;i&gt;binding&lt;/i&gt; is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while metamorphosed, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Minimus Containment&lt;/i&gt;: The subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or less and held within some gem, jar, or similar object. The &lt;i&gt;binding&lt;/i&gt; is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while contained, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can&apos;t dispel a &lt;i&gt;binding&lt;/i&gt; spell with &lt;i&gt;dispel magic&lt;/i&gt; or a similar effect, though an &lt;i&gt;antimagic field&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;mage&apos;s disjunction&lt;/i&gt; affects it normally.

When determining the tentacles&apos; CMB, the tentacles use your caster level as their base attack bonus and receive a +4 bonus due to their Strength and a +1 size bonus.

The water is lowered within a squarish depression whose sides are up to caster level x 10 feet long. In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as a deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell.

If successful, that spell ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a 7th-level caster casts &lt;i&gt;dispel magic&lt;/i&gt;, targeting a creature affected by &lt;i&gt;stoneskin&lt;/i&gt; (caster level 12th) and &lt;i&gt;fly&lt;/i&gt; (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the &lt;i&gt;stoneskin&lt;/i&gt; (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the &lt;i&gt;fly&lt;/i&gt; (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the &lt;i&gt;stoneskin&lt;/i&gt; would have been dispelled, leaving the &lt;i&gt;fly&lt;/i&gt; intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a &lt;i&gt;wall of&lt;/i&gt; fire). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster &lt;i&gt;summon&lt;/i&gt;ed by &lt;i&gt;summon&lt;/i&gt; monster), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item&apos;s caster level (DC = 11 + the item&apos;s caster level). If you succeed, all the item&apos;s magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a &lt;i&gt;bag of&lt;/i&gt; holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item&apos;s physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Counterspell&lt;/i&gt;: When &lt;i&gt;dispel magic&lt;/i&gt; is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell.

First, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the &lt;i&gt;gate&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;gate&lt;/i&gt; itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster&apos;s choice) oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;i&gt;gate&lt;/i&gt; has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the &lt;i&gt;gate&lt;/i&gt; from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Planar Travel&lt;/i&gt;: As a mode of planar travel, a &lt;i&gt;gate&lt;/i&gt; spell functions much like a &lt;i&gt;plane shift&lt;/i&gt; spell, except that the &lt;i&gt;gate&lt;/i&gt; opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a &lt;i&gt;gate&lt;/i&gt; from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you-anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A &lt;i&gt;gate&lt;/i&gt; cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may hold the &lt;i&gt;gate&lt;/i&gt; open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Calling Creatures&lt;/i&gt;: The second effect of the &lt;i&gt;gate&lt;/i&gt; spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the &lt;i&gt;gate&lt;/i&gt; to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the &lt;i&gt;gate&lt;/i&gt;, although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a &lt;i&gt;gate&lt;/i&gt; that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has a material cost of 10,000 gp in rare incense and offerings. This cost is in addition to any cost that must be paid to the called creatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual, you may call either a single creature or several creatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In either case, their total HD cannot exceed twice your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD does not exceed your caster level. A creature with more HD than your caster level can&apos;t be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the &lt;i&gt;lesser planar ally&lt;/i&gt; spell for appropriate rewards. Some creatures may want their payment in livestock rather than in coin, which could involve complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note:&lt;/i&gt; When you use a calling spell such as &lt;i&gt;gate&lt;/i&gt; to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type.&lt;/p&gt;",PFRPG Core,"Glory (9), Trade (9)",Connects two planes for travel or summoning.,NULL

When the description is done, the hand streaks off in search of a subject that fits the description.

If the subject chooses not to follow, the hand continues to beckon for the duration of the spell, then disappears. If the spell expires while the subject is en route to you, the hand disappears; the subject must then rely on its own devices to locate you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If more than one subject in a 5-mile radius meets the description, the hand locates the closest creature.

Creatures that leave the area and come back are not protected. You must overcome a creature&apos;s spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of &lt;i&gt;protection from evil&lt;/i&gt;), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies&apos; spell resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;magic circle&lt;/i&gt; against evil&lt;/i&gt; can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;lesser planar binding&lt;/i&gt;, planar binding,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;greater planar binding&lt;/i&gt; spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the &lt;i&gt;magic circle&lt;/i&gt;. The creature cannot cross the circle&apos;s boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell&apos;s area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal &lt;i&gt;protection from evil&lt;/i&gt; spell for that creature only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;i&gt;magic circle&lt;/i&gt; leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through such means. You can prevent the creature&apos;s extradimensional escape by casting a &lt;i&gt;dimensional &lt;i&gt;anchor&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the &lt;i&gt;anchor&lt;/i&gt; effect lasts as long as the &lt;i&gt;magic circle&lt;/i&gt; does. The creature cannot reach across the &lt;i&gt;magic circle&lt;/i&gt;, but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the &lt;i&gt;magic circle&lt;/i&gt; more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A successful diagram allows you to cast a &lt;i&gt;dimensional &lt;i&gt;anchor&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; spell on the &lt;i&gt;magic circle&lt;/i&gt; during the round before casting any summoning spell. The &lt;i&gt;anchor&lt;/i&gt; holds any called creatures in the &lt;i&gt;magic circle&lt;/i&gt; for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a &lt;i&gt;magic circle&lt;/i&gt; prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the &lt;i&gt;lesser planar binding&lt;/i&gt; spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram-even a straw laid across it.

Then you can attempt to take control of a nearby body, forcing its soul into the &lt;i&gt;magic jar&lt;/i&gt;. You may move back to the jar (thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to possess another body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spell ends when you send your soul back to your own body, leaving the receptacle empty. To cast the spell, the &lt;i&gt;magic jar&lt;/i&gt; must be within spell range and you must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of effect to it. When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While in the &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;magic jar&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; you can sense and attack any life force within 10 feet per caster level (and on the same plane of existence).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You do need line of effect from the jar to the creatures. You cannot determine the exact creature types or positions of these creatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a group of life forces, you can sense a difference of 4 or more HD between one creature and another and can determine whether a life force is powered by positive or negative energy. (Undead creatures are powered by negative energy. Only sentient undead creatures have, or are, souls.) You could choose to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but which particular stronger or weaker creature you attempt to possess is determined randomly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attempting to possess a body is a full-round action. It is blocked by &lt;i&gt;protection from evil&lt;/i&gt; or a similar ward. You possess the body and force the creature&apos;s soul into the &lt;i&gt;magic jar&lt;/i&gt; unless the subject succeeds on a Will save. Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in the &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;magic jar&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; and the target automatically succeeds on further saving throws if you attempt to possess its body again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host&apos;s life force is imprisoned in the &lt;i&gt;magic jar&lt;/i&gt;. You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You can&apos;t choose to activate the body&apos;s extraordinary or supernatural abilities. The creature&apos;s spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the &lt;i&gt;magic jar&lt;/i&gt; if within range, sending the trapped soul back to its body.

The mouth cannot utter verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects.

The bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the creature begin in the round after it arrives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A task taking up to 1 minute per caster level requires a payment of 100 gp per HD of the creature called.

The called creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To create the trap, you must use a &lt;i&gt;magic circle&lt;/i&gt; spell, focused inward. The kind of creature to be bound must be known and stated. If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual&apos;s proper name in casting the spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The target creature is allowed a Will saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists the spell. If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap (spell resistance does not keep it from being called). The creature can escape from the trap by successfully pitting its spell resistance against your caster level check, by dimensional travel, or with a successful Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 your caster level + your Charisma modifier). It can try each method once per day. If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you. A &lt;i&gt;dimensional anchor&lt;/i&gt; cast on the creature prevents its escape via dimensional travel. You can also employ a calling diagram (see &lt;i&gt;magic circle&lt;/i&gt; against evil) to make the trap more secure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward. You make a Charisma check opposed by the creature&apos;s Charisma check. The check is assigned a bonus of +0 to +6 based on the nature of the service and the reward. If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours. This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. If you ever roll a natural 1 on the Charisma check, the creature breaks free of the spell&apos;s effect and can escape or attack you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the requested service is completed, the creature need only to inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge.

If the subject&apos;s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature&apos;s body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature&apos;s body at the time of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes 1 hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and form. It retains any class abilities, feats, or skill ranks it formerly possessed. Its class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points are unchanged. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores depend partly on the new body. First eliminate the subject&apos;s racial adjustments (since it is no longer necessarily of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below to its remaining ability scores. The subject of the spell gains two permanent negative levels when it is reincarnated. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can&apos;t be reincarnated). A character who died with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon being reincarnated. A spellcreature that doesn&apos;t prepare spells (such as a sorcerer) has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s possible for the change in the subject&apos;s ability scores to make it difficult for it to pursue its previous character class. If this is the case, the subject is advised to become a multiclass character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the table on the next page. For nonhumanoid creatures, a similar table of creatures of the same type should be created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A creature that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can&apos;t be returned to life by this spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can&apos;t be reincarnated. The spell can bring back a creature that has died of old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;d%&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Incarnation&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Str&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Dex&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Con&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;01&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Bugbear&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;02-13&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Dwarf&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;14-25&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Elf&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;-2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;26&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Gnoll&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;27-38&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Gnome&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;-2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;39-42&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Goblin&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;-2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;43-52&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Half-elf&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;53-62&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Half-orc&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;63-74&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Halfling&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;-2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;75-89&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Human&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;90-93&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Kobold&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;-4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;-2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;94&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Lizardfolk&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;95-98&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Orc&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;99&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Troglodyte&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;-2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;+4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;100&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Other (GM&apos;s choice)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;  The reincarnated creature gains all abilities associated with its new form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural armor, natural attacks, extraordinary abilities, and the like, but it doesn&apos;t automatically speak the language of the new form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;i&gt;wish&lt;/i&gt; or a &lt;i&gt;miracle&lt;/i&gt; spell can restore a reincarnated character to his or her original form.&lt;/p&gt;",PFRPG Core,,Brings dead subject back in a random body.,1000

When you cast &lt;i&gt;snare&lt;/i&gt; upon it, the cordlike object blends with its surroundings (DC 23 Perception check for a character with the trapfinding ability to locate). One end of the &lt;i&gt;snare&lt;/i&gt; is tied in a loop that contracts around one or more of the limbs of any creature stepping inside the circle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a strong and supple tree is nearby, the &lt;i&gt;snare&lt;/i&gt; can be fastened to it. The spell causes the tree to bend, straightening when the loop is triggered, dealing 1d6 points of damage to the creature trapped and lifting it off the ground by the trapped limb or limbs.

Wet earth becomes thick mud, dry earth becomes loose sand or dirt, and stone becomes soft clay that is easily molded or chopped.

A creature that succeeds on its save can move through the mud at half speed, and it can&apos;t run or charge. Loose dirt is not as troublesome as mud, but all creatures in the area can move at only half their normal speed and can&apos;t run or charge over the surface. Stone softened into clay does not hinder movement, but it does allow characters to cut, shape, or excavate areas they may not have been able to affect before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this spell does not affect dressed or worked stone, cavern ceilings or vertical surfaces such as cliff faces can be affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually, this causes a moderate collapse or landslide as the loosened material peels away from the face of the wall or roof and falls (treat as a cave-in with no bury zone, see Chapter 13).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A moderate amount of structural damage can be dealt to a manufactured structure by softening the ground beneath it, causing it to settle.

It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the reduction in damage associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes from your direction.

If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round&apos;s target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack.

A creature that enters the area while the &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;symbol&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;death&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the &lt;i&gt;symbol&lt;/i&gt; only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the &lt;i&gt;symbol&lt;/i&gt; is still active, it must save again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until it is triggered, the &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;symbol&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;death&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;symbol&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;death&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;symbol&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;death&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;symbol&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;death&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; works normally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a default, a &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;symbol&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;death&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;symbol&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;death&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; can&apos;t trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;symbol&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;death&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&apos;s triggering conditions cannot be changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, reading the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;symbol&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;death&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; to render it inoperative triggers it if the &lt;i&gt;symbol&lt;/i&gt; reacts to touch. You can&apos;t use a &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;symbol&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;death&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;symbol&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;death&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; remains untriggered if an item bearing the &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;symbol&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;death&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;symbol&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;death&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;symbol&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;death&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; can be based on a creature&apos;s name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, and hit points don&apos;t qualify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When scribing a &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;symbol&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;death&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the &lt;i&gt;symbol&lt;/i&gt;&apos;s effect. Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune&apos;s effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You also can attune any number of creatures to the &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;symbol&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;death&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as 10 creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as 25 creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes an additional 24 hours per 25 creatures. Any creature attuned to a &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;symbol&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;death&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when it is triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own &lt;i&gt;symbol&lt;/i&gt;s of &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;death&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Read magic&lt;/i&gt; allows you to identify a &lt;i&gt;symbol&lt;/i&gt; with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + the &lt;i&gt;symbol&lt;/i&gt;&apos;s spell level). Of course, if the &lt;i&gt;symbol&lt;/i&gt; is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the &lt;i&gt;symbol&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;symbol&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;death&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; can be removed by a successful &lt;i&gt;dispel magic&lt;/i&gt; targeted solely on the rune. An &lt;i&gt;erase&lt;/i&gt; spell has no effect on a &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;symbol&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;death&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. Destruction of the surface where a &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;symbol&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;death&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is inscribed destroys the &lt;i&gt;symbol&lt;/i&gt; but also triggers it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Symbol of &lt;i&gt;death&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; can be made permanent with a &lt;i&gt;permanency&lt;/i&gt; spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A permanent &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;symbol&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;death&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; that is disabled or has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, but then can be triggered again as normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note:&lt;/i&gt; Magic traps such as &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;symbol&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;death&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; are hard to detect and disable.

Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn&apos;t exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you.

Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the table at the end of this spell. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Familiarity:&lt;/i&gt; Very familiar is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. Studied carefully is a place you know well, either because you can currently physically see it or you&apos;ve been there often. Seen casually is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. Viewed once is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic such as &lt;i&gt;scrying.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;False destination is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you.

Dexterity and dodge bonuses to AC do not count for this calculation. (Creatures with an AC of 25 or higher, without considering Dexterity and dodge bonuses, take no damage from contact with the wall.) You can make the wall as thin as 5 feet thick, which allows you to shape the wall as a number of 10-by-10-by-5-foot blocks equal to twice your caster level. This has no effect on the damage dealt by the thorns, but any creature attempting to break through takes that much less time to force its way through the barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a Strength check as a full-round action.

If this damage kills the target, the spell pulls the creature&apos;s organs into a set of 4 canopic jars and seals them; 1d4 rounds later, the corpse revives as a mummy (if 8 HD or fewer) or an advanced mummy (if 9 HD or more).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mummy is not under your control, but the canopic jars give the bearer certain powers over it.

A &lt;i&gt;wall of lava&lt;/i&gt;&apos;s maximum height cannot exceed half of its width (with a minimum height of 5 feet). The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or object. A section of a &lt;i&gt;wall of lava&lt;/i&gt; can be destroyed by damage (hardness 4, hp 90), but if a section is destroyed, the remaining lava in the wall immediately fills in any such hole created, reducing the wall&apos;s overall size by one 5-foot square but remaining a contiguous barrier. Each time a weapon strikes a &lt;i&gt;wall of lava&lt;/i&gt;, it takes 2d6 points of fire damage (or the creature who strikes the wall takes 2d6 fire damage if the attack was via an unarmed strike or natural attack).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A creature can move through a &lt;i&gt;wall of lava&lt;/i&gt; as a full-round action by making a DC 25 Strength check-failure indicates that the creature is pushed back out of the wall to the point he just attempted to leave. A creature with a burrow speed can move through the wall using its burrow speed. An attempt to move through a &lt;i&gt;wall of lava&lt;/i&gt; inflicts 20d6 fire damage. A &lt;i&gt;wall of lava&lt;/i&gt; also radiates heat as if it were a &lt;i&gt;wall of fire&lt;/i&gt;, although the heat from a &lt;i&gt;wall of lava&lt;/i&gt; radiates from both sides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once per round as a move action, you can direct the &lt;i&gt;wall of lava&lt;/i&gt; to erupt. This causes a plume of lava to fire at any target within 60 feet of either side of the wall, but reduces the wall&apos;s overall size by 1d4 5-foot square sections. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target, which takes 10d6 points of fire damage on a hit. Holes created in a &lt;i&gt;wall of lava&lt;/i&gt; from this effect instantly reseal, reducing the overall size of the wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All damage inflicted by physical contact with a &lt;i&gt;wall of lava&lt;/i&gt; continues for 1d3 rounds after exposure ceases, but this additional damage is only half that dealt during actual contact (that is, 1d6 or 5d6 or 10d6 points per round).&lt;/p&gt;",APG,,"Wall damages foes that try to enter, periodically launches lava at nearby targets.",NULL

A spell or with a duration greater than that of the suppression resumes functioning normally when the suppression ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wall affects all magical effects, including spells, spelllike abilities, magical items, and any effects stemming from them that pass through the wall. The wall does not suppress a creature&apos;s ability to cast spells, use spell-like abilities, or any other sort of limited-use abilities even if the wall suppresses a particular application of those abilities. However, if a creature with magical abilities that are constant or otherwise always active passes through the wall, those abilities are suppressed for the normal duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wall blocks line of effect, so no spell or effect can pass through the wall, but it does not block line of sight. Magic items or spell effects with a higher caster level than yours are unaffected by the &lt;i&gt;wall of&lt;/i&gt; suppression.

These winds grant you a fly speed of 60 feet with perfect maneuverability. Neither your armor nor your load affects this fly speed.

This wave of terrain undulates as it passes over the world, harmlessly lifting or stretching objects, creatures, and phenomena with a connection to nature but tearing through and damaging anything else it encounters. When you cast the spell you must choose the wave&apos;s type, either a tsunami or a swell. If you choose a tsunami, you create a 30-foot-high tidal wave of earth or water hurtling across the landscape that lasts for 1 round per level. If you choose a swell, you create a more controlled and gentle 5-foot-high wave that lasts for 1 hour per level. Regardless of its form or composition, the crest of the wave extends 10 feet in front of and behind you, and 5 feet per level to both your left and right. You can stand or sit on the crest of this wave without any fear of falling off it and can even lie down and sleep (or take any other actions you could take if standing on solid ground) as it travels. You can grant up to one additional creature per level the ability to safely accompany you on this wave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you first create the wave, you must choose its path by facing the direction you wish it to travel. Once you make this decision, you cannot change it. The wave, in either version, moves at eight times your base land speed. Any object, creature, or phenomena strongly connected to, or a part of, the natural world simply rises up and down with the wave as it passes, taking no damage or injury. However, anything else coming into contact with the wave takes either 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage (if the tsunami) or 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage (if the swell).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wave damages any manufactured object or structure. On the Material Plane, it also damages any creature of the aberration, construct, outsider, or undead type, or with the extraplanar subtype. Creatures with the construct or undead type take double damage from the wave. Other creatures, or creatures with even one druid class level (regardless of their type), are considered a part of the natural world and are unaffected by the wave. Note that on other planes of existence, what is considered to be a part of the natural world may vary at the GM&apos;s discretion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wave can travel up or down the sides of natural features so long as it does not exceed a 45-degree angle. You cannot alter the dimensions of the wave as it travels. If the wave encounters terrain that it cannot incorporate into itself, the wave simply flows over or around the obstacle (creatures riding the wave are harmlessly displaced to the side to avoid the obstacle) unless the terrain occupies one-half or more of the area of the wave&apos;s crest. In such cases the spell ends in 1d6 rounds as the wave falters and collapses, unless its duration would normally cause it to expire prior to that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The momentum of the wave carries you forward through this new terrain without any injury until it collapses, at which point you suffer the normal effects of the terrain in which you are deposited. Terrain the wave cannot incorporate includes anything primarily made from fire (such as lava), air (such as an open cliff face), or something man-made (such as a city).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can only create the wave if standing on the ground.

If you do not have a Harrow deck, you can simulate the draws by rolling a d6 and a d10 for each of the nine cards, as detailed on page 293 of this book. Record the ability score and alignment associated with each card. Each of these cards grants a luck bonus or a penalty on a specific type of d20 check; the magnitude of the penalty or bonus depends upon how closely that particular card&apos;s alignment matches the target creature&apos;s alignment.

You can spend a bonus to modify an appropriate roll after the die is rolled, but cannot spend the bonus once you know the result of the roll.

The destination must be an open space on a solid surface. The spell&apos;s area overlaps walls and other solid and liquid objects (preventing intruders from bypassing the ward by &lt;i&gt;teleport&lt;/i&gt;ing into a wall or through similar means). A &lt;i&gt;teleport&lt;/i&gt;ing creature that is affected by a &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;teleport&lt;/i&gt; trap&lt;/i&gt; can resist the effect with a Will save-if the save is successful, the creature simply doesn&apos;t &lt;i&gt;teleport&lt;/i&gt; at all (but the use of the &lt;i&gt;teleport&lt;/i&gt; effect is still consumed)-either to the intended location or the &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;teleport&lt;/i&gt; trap&lt;/i&gt;&apos;s actual destination. A DC 27 Knowledge (arcana) allows such a creature to recognize the &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;teleport&lt;/i&gt; trap&lt;/i&gt;&apos;s presence, but does not reveal the trap&apos;s linked destination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At your discretion, the &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;teleport&lt;/i&gt; trap&lt;/i&gt; can exclude a category of creatures, such as an alignment, a type of creature, or creatures that carry a specific item or know a password (though this only works if the creature is &lt;i&gt;teleport&lt;/i&gt;ing out of the area, not into it). You select this option and the conditions at the time you cast the spell. Overly complicated conditions may cause the spell to fail entirely. Multiple castings of &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;teleport&lt;/i&gt; trap&lt;/i&gt; can be linked to cover a larger area, allowing &lt;i&gt;teleport&lt;/i&gt;ed creatures to be directed to a single point within the combined area of the spells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Teleport trap&lt;/i&gt; can be made permanent at the cost of 7,000 gp.

This second spell rides along with the &lt;i&gt;nightmare&lt;/i&gt;, affecting the target as soon as it wakes from its fitful sleep. Any spell can be sent along with the &lt;i&gt;nightmare&lt;/i&gt;, so long as it is of 6th level or lower, affects one target (which is always the &lt;i&gt;nightmare&lt;/i&gt;&apos;s recipient), and does not deal hit point damage. The second spell&apos;s range is irrelevant for the purposes of &lt;i&gt;vision of Lamashtu&lt;/i&gt;, and even touch attacks can be delivered in this manner (you must still make a successful touch attack in order to affect the target, though, with the act of touching occurring within the context of the victim&apos;s &lt;i&gt;nightmare&lt;/i&gt;). The target is allowed to save against the second spell if a save is allowed. For example, a cleric of Lamashtu could send &lt;i&gt;bestow curse&lt;/i&gt; along as part of a &lt;i&gt;vision of Lamashtu&lt;/i&gt;, but not &lt;i&gt;blade barrier&lt;/i&gt; (affects an area), &lt;i&gt;destruction&lt;/i&gt; (too high level), or &lt;i&gt;inflict moderate wounds&lt;/i&gt; (deals hit point damage).&lt;/p&gt;",Inner Sea World Guide,,,NULL

Alternatively, when cast within your demiplane, you may add (or remove) one of the following features to your demiplane with each casting of the spell, in which case it has an instantaneous duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alignment: Your plane gains the (mildly) chaos-, good-, evil-, law-, or neutral-aligned alignment trait (see Alignment Traits, &lt;i&gt;GameMastery Guide&lt;/i&gt; 187). You cannot give your demiplane an alignment trait for an alignment you do not have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bountiful: Your demiplane gains a thriving natural ecology, with streams, ponds, waterfalls, and plants. The demiplane provides enough plant-based food (nuts, grains, fruit, fungi, and so on) to support one Medium creature for every 10-foot cube of the demiplane. The demiplane does not have any animals unless you transport them there, but the ecology can sustain itself for as long as the demiplane exists without requiring watering, gardening, pollination, and so on, and dead organic material decays and returns to the soil in the normal manner. If your demiplane has ambient light, these plants are normal, familiar surface plants; if it is a realm of twilight or darkness, these plants are fungi and other plants adapted to near-darkness or underground locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elemental: Your plane gains the air-, earth-, fire-, or water-elemental dominant trait (see Elemental and Energy Traits, &lt;i&gt;GameMastery Guide&lt;/i&gt; 186).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gravity: By default a demiplane&apos;s gravity is normal and oriented in one direction, like what most creatures are used to on the Material Plane. By selecting this feature, the plane&apos;s gravity is heavy, light, none, objectively directional, or subjectively directional (see Gravity, &lt;i&gt;GameMastery Guide&lt;/i&gt; 184).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seasonal: The demiplane has a seasonal cycle and a light cycle, usually similar to those of a land on the Material Plane, but customizable as you see fit (for example, your demiplane could always be winter, day and night could alternate every 4 hours, and so on).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shape: By default, the demiplane has a fixed shape and borders. By selecting this feature, you may make your plane self-contained so it loops upon itself when a creature reaches one edge (see Shape and Size, &lt;i&gt;GameMastery Guide&lt;/i&gt; 185). You may designate areas or locations on the edges of your plane where this occurs (such as a pair of secret doors or a path in the woods) or apply it to the entire plane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structure: Your demiplane has a specific, linked physical structure, such as a giant tree, floating castle, labyrinth, mountain, and so on. (This option exists so you can pick a theme for your plane without having to worry about the small details of determining what spells you need for every hill, hole, wall, floor, and corner).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can make this spell permanent with the &lt;i&gt;permanency&lt;/i&gt; spell, at a cost of 20,000 gp.

You must be on the Astral or Ethereal Plane or on a plane that has access to one of those planes (such as the Material Plane) to cast this spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you cast the spell, you decide whether the demiplane is within the Astral or the Ethereal Plane. It is filled with air or water (decided by you). The plane is generally flat and featureless, such as an earth, stone, water, or wood floor. The walls and ceiling of the plane may appear like solid earth, stone, wood, or water, or they may end in mist, a featureless void, or a similar unreal-looking border. The plane&apos;s environmental conditions are those of a temperate spring day on the Material Plane. You determine the plane&apos;s light level (bright, normal, dim, or darkness), which affects the entire plane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no native creatures or plants on this plane, though you may bring some there (if the plane&apos;s light is bright or normal, it counts as sunlight for growing plants). The environment of the plane counts as normal terrain for the purpose of effects that target earth, stone, wood, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, you could use &lt;i&gt;move earth&lt;/i&gt; to create a hill or &lt;i&gt;wall of stone&lt;/i&gt; to create a barricade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you finish casting this spell, you may bring yourself and up to seven other creatures to the plane automatically by joining hands in a circle. The demiplane is another plane of existence, and therefore is outside the range of any spell or ability that cannot affect or reach other planes. Creatures can only enter the plane by the use of planar travel magic such as &lt;i&gt;astral projection&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;etherealness&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;plane shift&lt;/i&gt;. You are considered very familiar with your entire demiplane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a standard action, you may eject a creature from your demiplane. The creature may resist with a Will saving throw. An ejected creature goes to the closest plane to your demiplane (usually the Astral Plane or the Ethereal Plane, but if you cast this spell on the Material Plane, the creature is sent to the Material Plane). When the spell ends, the plane dissolves, and all creatures in the plane are ejected in this manner with no saving throw. The plane cannot be dispelled, but a creature on the plane can destroy it by using &lt;i&gt;limited &lt;i&gt;wish&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, mage&apos;s disjunction, &lt;i&gt;miracle&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;wish&lt;/i&gt; and making a successful dispel check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are within the demiplane, you can add to its area by casting the spell again. Alternatively, you may cast this spell again to reset the duration of an existing area to that of your latest casting. If the duration on one area of the demiplane ends and other parts remain, creatures in the expiring area are shunted to remaining areas. If a collapsing portion of the demiplane would leave one section cut off from other sections of the demiplane (for example, if there were three areas connected in a straight line and the center part expired), the stranded sections count as separate demiplanes under your control. You may reconnect these stranded sections by the spell again to create a linked area between the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can make this spell permanent with the &lt;i&gt;permanency&lt;/i&gt; spell, at a cost of 17,500 gp.

This symbol indicates that the target has transgressed and that the faithful should not help it. Likewise, the target is not to be persecuted because of the mark (though this would not keep members of a lawful faith from imprisoning a known criminal if these crimes were known to have taken place after he gained the mark).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, the target is no longer affected by helpful spells cast by the faithful and is always treated as an enemy for the purpose of other spells cast by those of your faith. For example, &lt;i&gt;cure light wounds&lt;/i&gt; cast by a member of your faith has no effect on the target. If the target were traveling with a cleric of your faith who cast &lt;i&gt;prayer&lt;/i&gt;, that spell would penalize rather than aid the target, despite the target&apos;s friendship with the cleric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, if the target is a divine spellcaster, a member of a prestige class of your faith, or otherwise has some ability because the target belongs to your faith, it cannot use those abilities while the mark remains in place. For example, a paladin of your faith would be unable to cast paladin spells or use lay on hands or other class abilities. The target can join another faith to regain the use of these abilities, but the mark remains visible to those of your faith, even if those of the new faith accept the target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This powerful spell with no saving throw is used to punish severe transgressions that do not deserve death or when you prefer to be merciful rather than meting out a more severe punishment. However, the spell has one drawback that prevents it from being overused. If the target did not commit any acts or misdeeds against your faith, the spell does not affect it but affects you instead, even if you are innocent of the charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This potential backlash prevents inquisitions run by corrupt members of the faith, and it means that most accusations of misconduct are carefully investigated (and usually verified with magic) before this sentence is handed down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mark can be removed like any other curse effect. In addition, a member of your faith can use &lt;i&gt;atonement&lt;/i&gt; to break the curse if he makes a caster level check against your caster level; &lt;i&gt;remove curse&lt;/i&gt; also requires a caster of your faith and a caster level check to end the &lt;i&gt;reprobation&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;",Ultimate Magic,,Marked target is shunned by your religion.,NULL

You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to strike your target. On a successful hit, you deal 1d6 points of force damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6). For every 5 caster levels you possess beyond 5th, you gain a second ball of force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A creature struck by any of these is subject to a bull rush attempt. The force has a Strength modifier equal to your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (whichever is highest). The CMB for the force&apos;s bull rush uses your caster level as its base attack bonus, adding the force&apos;s Strength modifier and a +10 bonus for each additional blast directed against the same target. Each sphere of force makes its own separate bull rush attempt-if multiple spheres strike one target, you make multiple CMB checks but only take the highest result to determine success. If the bull rush succeeds, the force pushes the creature away from you in a straight line, and the creature must make a Reflex save or fall prone. This spell pushes an unattended object struck by it 20 feet away from you, provided it weighs no more than 25 pounds per level (maximum 250 pounds).

Blast barrier, however, has proven to be an exceptionally versatile spell as far as terrains are concerned, for it works equally well in swamps, deserts, or any region where the ground is soft or easy to shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When you cast blast barrier, you cause a rippling wall of loose earth, mud, snow, sand, or gravel to spring up in a designated space within the spell&apos;s range. This wall provides total cover to all Large or smaller creatures and objects. The barrier can only spring up in an area of natural, unworked ground. The energy that forms the wall&apos;s matrix is unstable, and you must concentrate to maintain the wall&apos;s shape. A blast barrier has an AC of 9, hardness 0, and 5 hit points per caster level. When a blast barrier reaches 0 hit points, or when you cease concentrating on maintaining it, the energies that maintain the barrier&apos;s shape fail with explosive results, sending sharp chunks of the materials comprising the wall and magical energy out along both sides. Any creature that is adjacent to a blast barrier when it explodes takes 2d6 points of slashing damage and 1d6 points of sonic damage per 3 caster levels (maximum 6d6). A successful Reflex save halves the total damage done. Spell resistance applies as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This instability can make using a blast barrier risky, but many of the spellcasters that pioneered the spell became experts at its tactical applications, often using the barriers to cover an escape while lobbing spells and parting shots, hoping to trigger the barrier&apos;s destruction just as their would-be pursuers approached.&lt;/p&gt;",Inner Sea Magic,,,NULL

A creature affected by this spell must roll two d20s whenever a situation calls for a d20 roll (such as an attack roll, a skill check, or a saving throw) and must use the lower of the two results generated. As with the aura shed by actual pugwampies, this spell has no effect on animals, gremlins, or gnolls.

The chain exists as long as you carry it; if you ever drop the chain, give it to another, or are disarmed, it immediately vanishes and the spell&apos;s duration ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chain radiates darkness in a 10-foot-radius spread around you, reducing the illumination level in this area by one step, but not below the level of dim light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can wield the &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;shadow&lt;/i&gt; barbs&lt;/i&gt; as a spiked chain as if you were fully proficient with spiked chains.

Any creature that starts its turn within the area of the spinning blades takes 1d4 points of damage for every two caster levels (maximum 10d4 at 20th level) and the damage bypasses DR/silver.  Furthermore, the daggers ward off some attacks, in a way similar to the &lt;i&gt;warding weapon&lt;/i&gt; spell (see page 48). While subject to this spell, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity for casting spells, even from creatures with the Disruptive feat. Creatures with the Spellbreaker feat (&lt;i&gt;Core Rulebook&lt;/i&gt; 134) can easily bypass this defensive property, though they still take damage from the spell. Your casting (even failing to cast defensively) still provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures with that feat.  Lastly, the blades that serve as the focus for this spell can be enchanted for greater effect. When all of the blades share the same enhancement bonus and special weapon qualities, a creature that is damaged by this spell is also treated as if hit by one of these weapons. For example, if a 12th-level magus casts this spell using four &lt;i&gt;+1 frost mithral daggers&lt;/i&gt; as focus, the damage dealt by the blades would be 6d4+1 plus 1d6 cold damage, as long as the daggers were commanded to be sheathed in ice.

While under the effects of this spell, the ship has magical propulsion that gives it a maximum speed of 120 feet and an acceleration of 30 feet (see the Skull  and  Shackles Player&apos;s Guide for details). The ship&apos;s pilot uses the normal sailing skill to control the ship while under this spell&apos;s effects, and can command it to dive and ascend as part of the vessel&apos;s normal movement. Despite the magical propulsion, the ship still requires its crew to perform its normal functions.  The spell protects the ship and all aboard from the dangers of drowning and pressure, but not from damage from outside obstacles or creatures. The bubble cannot be used offensively and prevents an affected ship from rising into a space that won&apos;t accommodate it (like a sea cave too small to contain it or under another vessel).

The target may instead increase its base speed by 30 feet for 1 round by reducing the spell&apos;s total remaining duration by 1 hour.  &lt;i&gt;Fall&lt;/i&gt;: A cloak of autumn leaves appears on the target. While the spell remains in effect, the target gains a +2 morale bonus on Fortitude saves. The target can decide to roll twice on any saving throw against disease or poison and take the higher result by reducing the spell&apos;s total remaining duration by 1 hour.  &lt;i&gt;Winter&lt;/i&gt;: A flutter of snow and crisp air surrounds the target. While this spell remains in effect, the target automatically succeeds at Acrobatics skill checks made to avoid falling while moving across slick or narrow surfaces.

The space holds as many as 10 creatures of any size.  When this spell is cast upon a 5-foot-square part of a wall, it creates an extradimensional space adjacent to the Plane of Shadow. Creatures in the extradimensional space are hidden beyond the reach of spells (including divinations) unless those spells work across planes. The space holds as many as 10 creatures (of any size). The entrance to the extradimensional space remains visible as an area that is darker than the ambient illumination.  Spells cannot be cast across the extradimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the extradimensional space can see out of it as if a 5-foot-by-5-foot door or window were centered on the affected surface. The window is invisible (though it is within the shadowed entrance to the spell, which is visible), and even creatures that can see the window from the outside can&apos;t see through it. Anything inside the extradimensional space is ejected when the spell ends. Only one creature may enter or exit the extradimensional space at a time.  The entrance is only open when the area around it is in dim light. Any other level of light (brighter or darker) closes the entrance, trapping creatures inside the extradimensional space. If the entrance is closed when the spell expires, there is a 50% chance that creatures in it are ejected into the Shadow Plane instead of the location of the entrance. If this occurs, the creatures appear on the Shadow Plane 1d10 miles in a random direction from their corresponding location on the Material Plane. The spell has no effect if cast on a plane that is not adjacent to the Shadow Plane.  Because the extradimensional space is adjacent to the Shadow Plane, any &lt;i&gt;shadow walk&lt;/i&gt; spell or similar effect that allows travel to the Shadow Plane is more accurate, reducing the distance creatures arrive off-target by half.&lt;/p&gt;",Advanced Race Guide,,,NULL

The flame does not harm you. During this spell&apos;s duration, each time you leave your space, you create a trail of fire that burns within the spaces you move through for 1 round before it burns out. You can leave up to 60 feet of flame trail each round, assuming you are Small or Medium. If you are larger than Medium, the maximum trail length is reduced based on your size. If you are Large, you can leave a trail up to 30 feet long (and 10 feet wide), and if you are Huge, you can leave a trail up to 15 feet long (and 15 feet wide); even larger casters can only leave a trail up to 10 feet long (and as wide as your space) each round. You choose where to leave a flame trail.  Creatures that start their turn adjacent to the flame trail take 1d6 points of fire damage. Creatures that start their turn within the flame trail or that enter an area of flame take a number of points of fire damage equal to 1d6 + 1 per caster level (maximum +10). If a creature moves into an area of the flame trail multiple times in a round, it takes this damage each time it enters the area of the flame trail.

If the targeted cloud is a magical effect, you must succeed at a caster level check (DC 11 + the effect&apos;s caster level) to inhale it. Inhaling the cloud removes it from the area, leaving normal air in its place. If the cloud is too large for you to affect with a single casting of this spell, you may instead inhale a portion of the cloud, but you must inhale the portion of the cloud closest to you. This spell has no effect on gaseous creatures. It can only affect an instantaneous-duration cloud (such as a breath weapon) if you ready an action to cast the spell in response.  While inhaled, the cloud does not harm you. You may keep the cloud harmlessly contained within you for up to 1 round per level, but you must hold your breath to do so (even if you do not normally have to breathe). If the cloud has a duration, the time the cloud is contained within you counts toward that duration. As a standard action, you may release the stored cloud as a breath weapon, filling a 60-foot cone (or the cloud&apos;s original area, if smaller than a 60-foot cone). Any creature in the breath&apos;s area is subject to its normal effects, making saving throws and spell resistance checks as appropriate against the cloud&apos;s original DC. The exhaled cloud resumes its duration, if any. Exhaling the stored cloud ends this spell. If you do not exhale the cloud before this spell&apos;s duration expires, you suffer the cloud&apos;s effects and automatically fail any saving throw to resist it.&lt;/p&gt;",Advanced Race Guide,,,NULL

The sphere is treated in all ways as an area of severe wind (&lt;i&gt;Core Rulebook&lt;/i&gt; 439), applying a -4 penalty on ranged weapon attacks that pass through it. The sphere moves 30 feet per round. As part of this movement, it can ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a target. If it enters a space containing a Medium or smaller creature, it stops moving for that round and generates a sharp thrust of wind to bull rush the creature. The sphere&apos;s CMB for bull rush combat maneuvers uses your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +2 bonus for its Strength score (14). Whether or not the bull rush is successful, the creature takes 1d6 points of nonlethal bludgeoning damage from the attack. If the bull rush fails, the creature is still subject to the severe winds from the sphere as long as they remain in the same square as it. A &lt;i&gt;gusting sphere&lt;/i&gt; rolls over objects or barriers that are less than 4 feet tall.

During the first round of the spell, the winds sweep the designated area clear of anything  of Small or smaller size, blowing it outward to the sides of the spell&apos;s effect (50% chance of landing on either side). You may move within the effect without penalty, though all other creatures are subject to the wind&apos;s effects. On the second and all later rounds of the spell, the edges of the effect are treated as a wind wall. If the effect includes a body of water or other liquid, the winds create a channel up to 40 feet deep into the surface of the liquid.

If the target fails his save against this spell, he is not compelled to act in any way until the specified trigger circumstances are encountered. He also has no knowledge of the details of the spell affecting him, and has no memory of the last 10 minutes (although he might come to notice the missing time or the presence of the caster). He can function as he &lt;i&gt;wish&lt;/i&gt;es until the events you detailed as the condition take place. Upon experiencing the prerequisite condition, the target is forced to perform the course of action you described as per the spell &lt;i&gt;dominate person&lt;/i&gt;. (If the compelled action is against the victim&apos;s nature, he immediately gains a new saving throw at a +5 bonus against the spell to end its effects.) For the next hour, the target acts as you dictated, doing all he can to fulfill your command. If, at the end of the hour, the target still has not completed your command, the target is released from the enchantment and the spell ends. Once the course of action is completed, the spell ends. The target has full memory of acts performed during this hour.  It&apos;s difficult to detect an &lt;i&gt;unconscious agenda&lt;/i&gt; before the spell is triggered. Casting &lt;i&gt;detect magic&lt;/i&gt; on one affected by it only reveals an aura of enchantment if the caster of &lt;i&gt;detect magic&lt;/i&gt; has a higher caster level then the caster of &lt;i&gt;unconscious agenda&lt;/i&gt;. Even if the spell is detected, it can only be removed by &lt;i&gt;break enchantment&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;limited &lt;i&gt;wish&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;remove curse&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;miracle&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;wish&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Dispel magic&lt;/i&gt; does not affect &lt;i&gt;unconscious agenda&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;",RotRL-AE-Appendix,,,NULL

Creatures with an attitude of less than helpful will not tolerate this spell, and it automatically fails to work on them. An intelligent animal or magical beast must be a willing subject in order for this spell to take effect. Any items that the creature wears (such as a harness or saddle) or carries (such as those stowed in saddlebags) are transformed along with the creature.  While miniaturized, the creature is under an effect similar to that of a &lt;i&gt;flesh to stone&lt;/i&gt; spell: It is mindless and inert, and does not seem alive when viewed with spells like &lt;i&gt;deathwatch&lt;/i&gt;. However, you may return the creature to its normal form at any time simply by placing the figurine on the ground, touching it, and uttering a word of command. Otherwise, the creature remains in miniature form unless the spell is broken, such as by &lt;i&gt;dispel magic&lt;/i&gt; or stronger magic. Unlike a &lt;i&gt;flesh to stone&lt;/i&gt; spell, a creature affected by &lt;i&gt;carry companion&lt;/i&gt; is unaffected by &lt;i&gt;stone to flesh&lt;/i&gt;.

For example, if the target has been dominated by a vampire, you can use evidence left in the target&apos;s mind to learn about that vampire. Each minute you concentrate on the spell, you can learn your choice of one of the following pieces of information.  &lt;i&gt;Direction&lt;/i&gt;: The controller&apos;s general direction and distance.  &lt;i&gt;Emotion&lt;/i&gt;: The controller&apos;s emotional state (gloating, sated, frightened, angry, and so on).  &lt;i&gt;Image&lt;/i&gt;: A powerful iconic image relevant to the controller or its connection to the target, such as a symbol on a door or a name on a gravestone.  &lt;i&gt;Location&lt;/i&gt;: The controller&apos;s general location, such as in a large city or on a ship.  &lt;i&gt;Name&lt;/i&gt;: The name by which the target knows its controller (if any).  All of this information is based on the last time the influencing creature linked itself to the target, either to issue a command or to receive sensory input from the target.

This works like a &lt;i&gt;scrying&lt;/i&gt; spell, except you can only view creatures on the same plane as you. Each time you cast the spell, you can choose to see one of three types of reflections in your mirror.  &lt;i&gt;Known Mirror&lt;/i&gt;: The current reflection in another mirror with which you are familiar.  &lt;i&gt;Known Person&lt;/i&gt;: The current reflection of a person you know well, assuming that person is near a mirror.  &lt;i&gt;Known Place&lt;/i&gt;: The current reflection of a place you know well, assuming the location is being reflected in a mirror.  You receive only visual information through this ability. You can choose to transmit information both ways so that a person reflected in the remote mirror can view whatever appears in the mirror you are using.  For example, Urion Petresky knows that Queen Elvanna keeps a mirror in a hall near her throne room. He can look through his own handheld mirror and see into this hall, even if the queen is not there. Alternatively, he can attempt to find the queen (wherever she is) by looking into his mirror; if, at that moment, the queen is near any mirror at all, he can see her. He may instead cast the spell and try to see into her throne room, hoping that someone has brought a mirror there. If any of these conditions fails, Urion sees nothing but his own reflection.

A creature that occupies a square from which a spear extends (or that is within 10 feet of the ground below) takes 2d6 points of piercing damage and 2d6 points of cold damage per square-creatures that take up more than 1 square can be hit by multiple spears if your caster level is high enough. The explosive growth can also trip foes. When the spears erupt from the ground, they attempt a combat maneuver check to trip any targets that take damage from the spears, with a total bonus equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest.

A deadfall over a 10-foot square deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 7d6), a deadfall over a 15- foot square deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per 3 caster levels (maximum 5d6), and so on, to a maximum size of a 25- foot square. Only creatures that are on the outer edge of the area affected by a &lt;i&gt;conjure deadfall&lt;/i&gt; spell can attempt Reflex saves to avoid the effect; creatures whose space does not touch the edge of the deadfall do not receive a save.  In order to deal damage, the conjured deadfall must start at least 10 feet above the tallest creature in the area to be affected. A conjured deadfall is as tall as it is wide, and the spell fails if you attempt to conjure a deadfall in an area already occupied by a creature or object (including the ceiling). Regardless, a deadfall conjured by this spell disappears as soon as it deals damage or strikes the ground.&lt;/p&gt;",Dungeoneers Handbook,,,NULL
Create Holds,transmutation,,,"druid 4, ranger 3, sorcerer/wizard 4",1 standard action,"V, S, M (handful of pebbles)",medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level),,path of handholds,,1 hour/level (D),none,no,"&lt;p&gt;You create a path of handholds on earthen, plaster, stone, or wooden walls (not on walls made of metal or other, harder materials). The handholds are created in pairs and are approximately 3 feet apart, located in a specific path indicated by your gestures while casting the spell. The handholds&apos; path can span up to 30 feet out from you plus an additional 10 feet per 3 caster levels (maximum 90 feet at 18th level). The handholds protrude approximately 6 inches from the wall, measure 10 inches lengthwise, and are perfectly suited for gripping with fingers or claws.

Determine Depth,divination,,,"bard 2, druid 2, sorcerer/wizard 2",1 standard action,"V, S",touch,,,solid surface touched,"concentration, up to 1 round/level (D)",none,no,"&lt;p&gt;With a touch, you can determine the exact thickness of a wall, ceiling, or other solid barrier, measuring from the point you are touching to the direct opposite side of the barrier in a straight line. You can only detect depths or widths of up to 10 feet per caster level (maximum 200 feet at 20th level); amounts in excess of this limit are detected as being the maximum you are able to detect. So, for example, a 5th-level wizard using this spell on a 60-foot-thick wall would detect that the wall is 50 feet thick.  &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Determine&lt;/b&gt; depth&lt;/i&gt; can be used on earthen, plaster, stone, or wooden surfaces, but not on walls made of metal or other, harder materials. This spell is useful to casters who want to get an idea of their surroundings, and as a preliminary measure to casting spells such as &lt;i&gt;passwall&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;dimension door&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;",Dungeoneers Handbook,,,NULL

The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.  &lt;i&gt;1st Round&lt;/i&gt;: Presence or absence of objects worth at least the specified amount.  &lt;i&gt;2nd Round&lt;/i&gt;: The most valuable object in range glows brighter than all of the others.

The hammer can be directed to attack one foe within range per round as a move action. It uses your caster level as its base attack bonus, modified by your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (whichever one is highest). On a hit, the &lt;i&gt;corpse hammer&lt;/i&gt; deals 1d6 points of damage per three caster levels (to a maximum of 6d6 points of damage).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Corpse hammer also has secondary effects based on the nature of the three bodies you use to create it. If the majority used to create it (at least two) were skeletal, the jagged bits of bone cause the hammer to deal slashing damage and increase its critical threat range to 19-20. On the other hand, if the majority were fleshy (at least two), the increased mass causes the spell to deal bludgeoning damage and increase its critical hit damage to x3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Undead that have been destroyed by positive energy or a similar effect that does not leave a corpse, like a &lt;i&gt;disintegrate&lt;/i&gt; spell, cannot be used to form a &lt;i&gt;corpse hammer&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;",Inner Sea Magic,,,NULL

The mark can be removed as described in the &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;mark of&lt;/i&gt; justice&lt;/i&gt;spell, or the other target can forgive the oath- breaker, which causes the mark to vanish.&lt;/p&gt;",Dwarves of Golarion,,,NULL

When cast, all creatures under the effect of the spell must be adjacent to one another, forming an unbroken chain of squares (which may include creatures sharing the same square). This chain does not need to be a straight line. Each target in the chain receives a +2 defection bonus to AC as long as the targets stay adjacent to at least one other creature affected by the spell; moving more than 5 feet from another target ends the spell with respect to that creature only. For example, a cleric could cast it on himself and four dwarves blocking a 20-foot-wide corridor; the cleric can move freely from the left side of the formation to the right side (whether in front of or behind the other targets) and not break the spell as long as he stays within 5 feet of at least one of them.&lt;/p&gt;",Dwarves of Golarion,,,NULL

When this spell is cast, the subject may attempt a Reflex save. Success indicates that the vines fail to take root and the spell has no effect. On a failed save, the subject&apos;s base speed is immediately reduced by 5 feet. Each round thereafter, the subject must make another successful Reflex save or his speed is reduced by another 5 feet. This occurs each round until he is reduced to a speed equal to half of what it was before the spell was cast.

A target&apos;s Will save prevents you from determining its exact relationship with another creature, and only one subject needs to succeed at this save to prevent you from determining its relationship with another creature. (So, for instance, if two brothers are in the area and one succeeds at his Will save, you could tell that they are siblings, but could not distinguish whether they are full- or half-siblings.)  Each round, you can turn to detect relations in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 6 inches of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 1 foot of wood or dirt will block it.  This spell functions by analyzing the blood and minds of creatures in the area, collectively examining these traits and comparing them to those of others in the area while looking for patterns.

Each ceremony provides a boon to two living, touched subjects for 1 hour per caster level, representing the divine gifts granted by your deity as well as the normal morale-boosting benefits of participating in an officiated ceremony. Bonuses granted by these boons are sacred bonuses if you channel positive energy or profane bonuses if you channel negative energy. (Bonuses in this section are referred to simply as sacred bonuses for ease of reading.) Only subjects whose alignments are within one step of your deity can be affected by this spell.  If you are using the downtime system from &lt;i&gt;Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Campaign&lt;/i&gt;, you may use additional resources to augment the effect of a particular ceremony. You may spend 10 Goods, Labor, or Influence or 2 Magic to create a larger ceremony and grant an additional boon that lasts for 1 day per caster level (up to a maximum of 5 days). The type of capital spent should reflect the preparation required for the specific ceremony. &lt;i&gt;Augmented&lt;/i&gt; boons affect the creatures touched as well as a number of intelligent, properly aligned creatures within medium range equal to your caster level (up to a maximum of 10 creatures), granting all subjects the benefits of the original boon as well as the benefits of an augmented boon, representing the divine gifts granted to these witnesses by your god.  Unless otherwise stated, use-activated abilities are supernatural abilities and abilities that emulate the effects of a spell are spell-like abilities; in either case, abilities granted by a boon are generally usable only once or until the duration of the spell ends, whichever comes first. Spell-like abilities are cast at a creature&apos;s highest caster level gained, or, if the creature has no caster level, CL 1st. Constant or passive effects and bonuses granted by this spell can be dispelled as normal, using your caster level to do so.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Funeral:&lt;/b&gt; A funeral service must involve a corpse and at least one willing companion or next of kin.

Outsiders without an outsider racial subtype (like genies, night hags, yeth hounds, or xills) are not affected by this spell.

First, the subject gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves when targeted by creatures of the chosen subtype.  Second, the subject immediately receives another saving throw (if one was allowed to begin with) against any spells or effects that possess or exercise mental control over the target creature. This functions in the same fashion as &lt;i&gt;protection from evil&lt;/i&gt;, but only when the effect stems from outsiders of the chosen subtype, and the target&apos;s saving throw is made with a +4 morale bonus (using the same DC as the original effect).  Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures of the chosen subtype in the same manner as detailed in &lt;i&gt;protection from evil&lt;/i&gt;.

For example, you might transform a desert to plains. To cast this spell, you must expend 10 uses of mythic power along with the material cost. This magically alters the area&apos;s climate and normal plants to those appropriate to the new terrain, but doesn&apos;t affect creatures or the configuration of the earth. Transforming rocky hills into forested areas converts grasses into shrubs and small trees, but doesn&apos;t flatten the hills or change the animals to suit the new environment.  You can alter the climate by one step (warm, temperate, or cold). The maximum extent of the terrain change is up to the GM, but in general is to a similar terrain type or one step within that terrain type (such as from a typical forest to a forest with massive trees or light undergrowth, from a shallow bog to a deep bog, and so on). You might be able to shift the land to a similar terrain type, such as turning a sparse forest into a relatively dry swamp. Local creatures adversely affected by these alterations either flee the area or quickly die, depending on their mobility and awareness of the change.  Multiple castings of the spell in the same area can create an area with radically different terrain and climate than the surrounding land. The GM can decide that certain terrain shifts are unsustainable and shorten the duration, or that some are suitable for the area and extend the duration.  This spell could have many secondary effects based on the nature of the change, the type of bordering terrain, and so on; these should be determined by the GM on a case-by-case basis. For example, transforming a desert requires drawing water up from underground to sustain the plants, which could deplete the water table in nearby areas. Creating a warm desert in the middle of a snowy tundra will create a bordering area of mud and frequent storms from the clash of hot and cold air fronts.  If you&apos;re at least 8th tier, you can expend 20 uses of mythic power instead of 10 to increase the range to 1 mile, the area to a 1-mile-radius emanation centered on you, and the duration to 1 month per caster level.&lt;/p&gt;",Mythic Adventures,,,10000

However, if the creature falls through a &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;gravity&lt;/i&gt; sphere&lt;/i&gt; and continues to fall in a non-affected area, the rest of the fall damage is calculated normally. For instance, if a creature falls through 20 feet of a low&lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;gravity&lt;/i&gt; sphere&lt;/i&gt; and an additional 30 feet outside the sphere, it would take 1d6 points of damage for the 20 feet of low &lt;i&gt;gravity&lt;/i&gt; plus 3d6 points of damage as normal for the 30 feet outside the sphere (for a total of 4d6 points of damage).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spell doesn&apos;t counteract or negate the effects of other spells that affect &lt;i&gt;gravity&lt;/i&gt;; both effects occur simultaneously.

The destruction of the item doesn&apos;t harm the creature wearing or carrying the item (although the item&apos;s destruction may put the creature in harm&apos;s way, such as if a magical rope were being used to cross a chasm at the time). If the offending creature wears or carries the item for less than 1 hour and passes it to a different creature, the countdown to the item&apos;s destruction starts over.

Any creature in the area when the spell is cast takes 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +10) and falls prone; creatures that succeed at a Reflex save take half damage and don&apos;t fall prone. Spell resistance applies to this initial effect.  A creature can walk within or through the area of ice at half its normal speed with a successful DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure by 4 or less means the creature can&apos;t move that round (and must succeed at a Reflex save or fall); failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Acrobatics skill on page 87 of the &lt;i&gt;Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook&lt;/i&gt; for details). Creatures that do not move on their turn do not need to attempt this check.  A 5-foot square of ice has hardness 0 and 3 hit points. The ice is an instantaneous effect, but persists as nonmagical ice. Under temperate conditions, the ice lasts 1 minute per level. In tropical environments, it might last only half as long.

Immediately, and at the beginning of each of your turns, every creature touching the ground within the area of the spell is the target of a grapple combat maneuver. Creatures that enter the area of effect are also automatically attacked. The ground does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The earth&apos;s CMB is equal to 5 + your caster level for the purpose of this combat maneuver check. Attempt the combat maneuver check only once each round and apply the result to all creatures in the area of effect.  Each time the ground succeeds at a combat maneuver check to grapple a foe, it drags the creature farther down, eventually forcing the creature below its surface. With the first successful check, the target gains the grappled condition. Grappled opponents can&apos;t move without first breaking the grapple (doing so requires a successful DC 20 combat maneuver or Escape Artist check). The ground receives a +5 bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple opponents it is already grappling. After the second successful grapple combat maneuver check, the grappled creature is pulled to the ground and becomes prone. On the third successful grapple combat maneuver check, the creature is fully buried and must hold its breath or begin suffocating.

The mark can be placed on any exposed portion of the creature, typically the head or forearm. The flesh around the handprint becomes rough and scaly, like the hide of a lizard. It also glows with a green radiance (shedding light as a torch) when brought within 60 feet of you. While the handprint glows, the target takes a -2 penalty to AC against your attacks and on saving throws to resist any spell you cast or spell-like ability you use.  Additionally, each day the target remains cursed, more and more of its flesh becomes covered in reptilian scales. The target must succeed at a Fortitude save each day or take 1d4 points of Charisma damage, 1 point of which is Charisma drain instead.

Weapons, shields, and mundane objects require a successful Craft skill check of the type required to craft the item in question, with a DC equal to the spell&apos;s save DC. Magic items require a successful Spellcraft or Use Magic Device skill check against the spell&apos;s save DC.

This record includes your current hit point total, physical ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution), and any conditional modifiers or conditions such as ability damage to physical ability scores, disease, negative levels, and poison. If at any point within the duration of the spell you are reduced to fewer than 0 hit points or are slain by a death effect that is not mind-affecting, you can immediately let your current physical body die and assume the record of your physical body on your next turn.

You still retain your original mind, and therefore don&apos;t regain any spells. You are still under any mental influences and energy drain effects you were under when you recalled the record of your physical body, but don&apos;t retain any physical effects such as bleed damage or poison (unless you suffered from these conditions at the time the spell was cast).

You can also adjust the power of the alignment aura up or down in level by a number of steps equal to 1/2 your level or fewer.  &lt;b&gt;Emotion Aura&lt;/b&gt;: Your manipulations mask the true emotions  of the target, instead depicting any combination of colors on the emotional spectrum that you wish. Creatures attempting Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Sense Motive checks against the target receive no bonuses on their checks based on information gleaned from the target&apos;s aura.  &lt;b&gt;Health Aura&lt;/b&gt;: You adulterate the target&apos;s aura to mask the condition of its physical body, revealing instead a wounded status, poison or disease status, and conditions of your choice. You likewise mask the target&apos;s available ki points or similar resources, manipulating its aura to suggest any number within the range normally available to the target.  &lt;b&gt;Magic Aura&lt;/b&gt;: You alter a creature or item&apos;s magic aura so that it registers to &lt;i&gt;detect magic&lt;/i&gt; (and spells with similar capabilities, like &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;analyze&lt;/i&gt; aura&lt;/i&gt;) as though it were nonmagical, a magic item of a kind you specify, or the subject of a spell you specify.

Each creature adjacent to a mushroom or in a mushroom&apos;s square must then succeed at a Fortitude save or become sickened for 1d4 rounds. The condition of creatures that fail multiple saving throws does not worsen, but each additional failed saving throw adds 1d4 rounds to the duration the creature is sickened.

For example, a staff might change to resemble a snake, a shield might change to resemble an enormous venomous beetle, or the hilt of a sword might change to resemble a scorpion&apos;s tail.  If this spell is cast on a held item, the wielder adds his Will save bonus to the saving throw. You must be able to see the item to cast this spell on it.

As long as the two targets are of the same size category, they are indistinguishable. As a consequence, if the targets are adjacent and a creature takes an action that would affect one of the targets (such as an attack, a targeted spell, or an area effect), that action has a 50% chance of affecting the other target instead.  Any action that would affect both of the creatures affects them both normally.  This spell does not deceive creatures that have &lt;i&gt;true seeing&lt;/i&gt;.

You must choose a specific object or place. A location chosen in this way can be no larger than a cube measuring 50 feet on a side. The aversion is entirely in the target&apos;s mind, so the chosen object or location itself isn&apos;t subject to any magical effect. If the target fails her saving throw, she can&apos;t come within 60 feet of the chosen object or place. She makes every reasonable effort to avoid the object of the aversion, but will not put herself in danger in order to maintain the aversion. For example, if the object of the aversion is a bridge but a forest fire is closing in and will likely kill the target, she ignores the aversion and crosses the bridge to save herself. If the target must ignore the conditions of the aversion, she is nauseated until she is no longer violating the aversion.  If the target succeeds at her saving throw, she is instead sickened while within 60 feet of the object or place, but isn&apos;t compelled to stay away from it.&lt;/p&gt;",Occult Adventures,,Cause the target to avoid an object or location.,NULL

You have no special empathy or connection with a creature you awaken-it is a free-willed creature.

Roll 3d6 to determine the Intelligence score of the awakened construct, and increase its Charisma score by 2d6. It gains feats and skill points according to its new Intelligence score, and the skill points are assigned appropriately for its function, as determined by the GM.  An awakened construct speaks one language that its creator spoke, plus one additional language that its creator knew per point of the construct&apos;s Intelligence bonus (if any).

Bilocation,conjuration,creation,,"psychic 8, sorcerer/wizard 9",1 standard action,V,close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels),,one duplicate,,1 round/level (D),none,no,"&lt;p&gt;The spell creates an identical copy of you, along with everything you wear and carry, anywhere you choose within range; you exist in two places at once until the spell ends. You and the duplicate use the same statistics and share the same resources. If the duplicate takes damage, for example, you deduct the damage from your hit point total. Similarly, if your duplicate expends a charge or daily use from a magic item you both wield, the charge or daily use is expended from the item you carry. If you or the duplicate drops or gives away something you&apos;re carrying, the item disappears from the other body as well. This spell doesn&apos;t duplicate artifacts; any you possess remain on you.  You perceive sensory information from your body and that of your duplicate simultaneously. The spell enables you to process the sensations so you don&apos;t find them disorienting.  When you take any action, you choose which of your bodies performs the action, but both bodies share the same pool of actions. For instance, if you take a standard action to cast a spell,  you can use either body as the point of origin, but the other body can&apos;t also take a standard action that round. Likewise, if your duplicate takes a full-round action, you couldn&apos;t take a standard or move action. Both bodies can take any number of free actions as usual; for example, both bodies could say different things or each drop a different item. If either body doesn&apos;t move during the round, that body can either take a 5-foot step or move your speed once as a free action.  The two bodies are affected by attacks, spells, and effects as though they were one person, taking the worse effect when applicable (for example, if the bodies would be subject to differing effects due to being at different ranges). If both bodies are in the area of the same &lt;i&gt;fireball&lt;/i&gt;, you would attempt the saving throw only once and take the damage only once. If one body is targeted by &lt;i&gt;hold person&lt;/i&gt;, both would become paralyzed on a failed save. Both bodies count as a single creature for effects that target a specific number of creatures, and they can&apos;t be chosen more than once for such effects. You do count your other body as another creature for most combat effects, such as flanking or determining cover. However, you don&apos;t count as two unique creatures for the purposes of teamwork feats or effects you use that can target only creatures other than yourself.  Any magical effect with a duration affecting you has its duration halved while you&apos;re bilocating. For example, the &lt;i&gt;hold person&lt;/i&gt; spell mentioned above would lose 2 rounds&apos; worth of duration per round until your duplicate disappeared. If you were under an eagle&apos;s splendor e ffect t hat h ad 1 minute remaining when you cast &lt;i&gt;bilocation&lt;/i&gt;, the effect would end after 5 rounds instead of 10. An effect shortened in this way lasts a minimum of 1 round total, and if an effect that lasts an odd number of rounds has 1 round remaining, it has its full effect on both of your bodies for that round.  When the spell ends, you decide whether you or your duplicate disappears. If you disappear, you become your duplicate. If you are carrying artifacts when you do this, they transfer with your consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;",Occult Adventures,,Exist in two places at once.,NULL

The spirit has the physical attributes of an &lt;i&gt;unseen servant&lt;/i&gt; and is capable of minor physical manipulations, with the ability to speak in quiet, ghostly whispers in whatever languages the creature knew while it was alive. The spirit isn&apos;t an undead creature, and isn&apos;t beholden to its caller. Whether you summoned the chosen spirit or a deceitful replacement, the spirit can refuse to answer your questions or attempt to deceive you using Bluff, though in either case these spirits can speak about only what they knew in life and have no knowledge of events that occurred after their deaths. Malevolent spirits might take advantage of their limited physical abilities to cause terrifying spectacles designed to scare the caster.  You must concentrate on maintaining the spell (as a standard action) in order to ask questions at the rate of one per round. You can ask a total of one question per caster level; the spirit answers each during the same round. When the spell ends, the spirit&apos;s ectoplasmic form fades and the soul returns to its rest.

You choose whether the mindscape is overt or veiled, and whether it&apos;s harmless or harmful. You can choose any shape and size trait, as well as any gravity trait (though you can&apos;t make it so the gravity is so strong it harms creatures within). The mindscape has normal time, no alignment traits, and normal magic.  You designate where both you and your subject appear. You don&apos;t need line of sight to draw the subject creature into the mindscape, but you must be aware of its presence within range. If you target an area with more than one sentient creature and you have never seen any of the creatures before (for example, if you know a group of soldiers is inside a barracks but you can&apos;t see them through the door), the subject of this spell is selected at random. If you have seen firsthand the creature you wish to target (continuing the example, if you spied the sergeant entering the room moments before), you can select it unerringly from among all the creatures. You must appear somewhere in your mindscape, though it&apos;s relatively easy to shield yourself from the view of any other creatures inside if they don&apos;t realize they&apos;re in a mindscape. You must also create a method of exit from the mindscape when you cast this spell, and that method must be possible to achieve based on the traits of the mindscape, even if it is obscure or difficult. The GM decides whether a method of escape is reasonable. Anything that would be a reasonable method of waking from a dream during deep sleep could allow one to leave a mindscape.  More creatures than the initial two can enter an existing mindscape, typically through the use of the &lt;i&gt;mindscape door&lt;/i&gt; spell. You can create illusory creatures within the mindscape  but you&apos;re able to direct or concentrate on only one at a time. Only this creature is believable; any others largely remain silent or speak generic, repetitive phrases.  As is normal with mindscapes, you and any other creatures within the mindscape are unable to take actions within the real world, and your bodies lose their Dexterity bonuses to AC.  If you choose to create a veiled mindscape, the first time another creature interacts with the environment, it can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the effect. Disbelieving a mindscape reveals to that creature that it&apos;s within a mindscape and gives it the knowledge needed to leave the mindscape, but doesn&apos;t free it from the mindscape. For example, if you create a mindscape that takes the form of a parlor inside a stately mansion, and your target creature succeeds at its Will save, it gains the understanding that walking out the front door of the mansion allows it to return to its physical body, but it must actually move through the mental landscape of the mansion to reach the front door and exit in order to flee the mindscape. If the mindscape is overt, the creature automatically knows how to exit if it so chooses.  This spell ends at any time that you choose to depart the mindscape, freeing the target as well. Any creature that drops below 0 hit points while inside the mindscape returns to its body. If this happens to you, the spell also ends, freeing anyone still inside.  &lt;i&gt;Create mindscape&lt;/i&gt; can be made permanent with a &lt;i&gt;permanency&lt;/i&gt; spell by a caster of 12th level or higher at a cost of 10,000 gp.

In the Dimension of Dreams, you move through a swirling sea of thoughts, desires, and emotions created by the minds of &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt;ers everywhere to reach your destination &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt;scape. Reaching the destination &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt;scape takes 1 hour. At any point before the spell&apos;s duration ends, you can dismiss the spell to return to where you started on the Material Plane. The connection between &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt;s and reality is inherently tenuous, and your ability to arrive precisely where you mean to is dependent on your familiarity with the &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt;er you&apos;re trying to find.

Somewhat familiar means that you have had contact with the &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt;ing character using one of those spells at least once in the past. Known creature means that while you know the creature whose &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt;scape you&apos;re trying to locate, you have not connected to its &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt;s with those spells. Not well known is a creature you have heard of, know by name and true identity, but have never met.  False identity means that whether or not you have met the creature, you know it only through a false identity. When trying to locate the &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt;scape of a creature known to you through a false identity, roll 1d20 + 80 on the table to obtain your results (instead of rolling d%), since there is no way for you to pinpoint the correct &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt;scape.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;On Target&lt;/b&gt;: You travel to the correct creature&apos;s current &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt;scape.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Off Target&lt;/b&gt;: You travel to an area near the target &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt;scape on the Ethereal Plane.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Dreamscape&lt;/b&gt;: You travel to a similar creature&apos;s &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt;scape on the Dimension of Dreams.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mishap&lt;/b&gt;: You and anyone else traveling with you experience a mishap during travel; each character takes 1d10 points of damage and must reroll on the table to see where it ends up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20 + 80. Each time Mishap comes up, the travelers take more damage and must reroll to see where they end up.  Regardless of the accuracy of your &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt; travel&lt;/i&gt;, you and your companions all arrive at the same location (except in the case of a mishap). Mindless creatures can&apos;t use &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt; travel&lt;/i&gt;, nor can creatures that can&apos;t &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt;.  You might be able to exit the &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt; near the creature on its home plane. If you and the other creatures are still in a &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt; when the &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt;er wakes up, the &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt;er can decide to bring you out onto its plane within 1d10 miles of itself. If it chooses not to, you and the other travelers are pushed into another &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt;scape or onto the Ethereal Plane. The spell ends when the creature wakes up, so you no longer have the option to dismiss the spell and return home. However, you do get enough warning that a spell is about to end that you can dismiss it before the &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt;er awakens and decides whether to allow you to arrive at its location.  You can use &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt; travel&lt;/i&gt; to travel to the &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt; of a creature on another plane, but this requires trekking through the &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt;s of outsiders. It takes 1d4+1 hours of uninterrupted travel to reach the destination &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt;, and each traveler must succeed at a Will save each hour spent traveling in this fashion. The DC of this save is 10 for the first hour, and increases by 5 for each hour thereafter. If a creature fails this saving throw, it becomes shaken for the remainder of the &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt; travel&lt;/i&gt; and for a number of hours thereafter equal to the amount of time spent using &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt; travel&lt;/i&gt; to reach the destination plane. After the first time a creature fails the saving throw, one of the following effects occurs (determined randomly by the GM). These effects are considered emotion effects, in addition to any other descriptors that apply.   &lt;table border =&apos;1&apos;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;d6&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Result&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Creature contracts cackle fever or mindfire (equal chance of either; see page 557 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Creature is cursed, as bestow curse; if the creature is a spellcaster, it instead acquires a random minor spellblight (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 94).&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Creature is attacked by a phantasmal killer, and is treated as having failed the initial saving throw to disbelieve it. The Fortitude save DC is equal to the Will save DC that the creature failed.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Creature is possessed as possession (see page 181) by an outsider (50% chance to be a creature from the destination plane; otherwise, it is a random hostile outsider).&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Creature is affected as feeblemind.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Creature is affected as insanity.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;   Traveling to a different planar destination decreases the accuracy of your &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt; transit. If you exit a creature&apos;s &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt; onto a plane different from the plane you started on, you end up in a random location on the destination plane.  If the target of your &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt; travel&lt;/i&gt; isn&apos;t &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt;ing, you and the other travelers can wait on the Dimension of Dreams until that creature begins sleeping.

Only you can pilot the vessel, and you can do so even if you aren&apos;t inside it. Your psychic vehicle buffers minds from the intense emotional tides of the Dimension of Dreams, rendering everyone inside immune to harmful emotion and fear effects. Unlike with &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt; travel&lt;/i&gt;, there is no chance the vessel arrives off target. In addition, you need not have met the target creature, but in that case you must have at least a reliable description of it. However, if you attempt to travel there with insufficient or incorrect information, you do need to roll, using the false identity entry from &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt; travel&lt;/i&gt;.  Creatures that disembark from your vehicle can either enter the &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt;scape or exit to the plane where the &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt;er&apos;s body lies, arriving within 1 mile of the &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt;er&apos;s body. All creatures that disembark from the vehicle onto a plane at the same time arrive in the same place. The &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt;er can&apos;t prevent the &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt; voyage&lt;/i&gt;rs from entering its &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt;, but can attempt a Will save to prevent a group of creatures from exiting to the plane where its body resides.  The psychic vehicle remains in the &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt; for the remainder of the spell&apos;s duration, even if it&apos;s unoccupied. A creature adjacent to the &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt;er can reenter the &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt; vessel as a full-round action through an illusory portal only subjects of the spell can see. You can return the vessel to the point where you cast &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt; voyage&lt;/i&gt; to allow any number of passengers to return to that plane, and can return it to the &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt; again. Either of these trips takes the same amount of time as the initial travel, and can be done any number of times within the spell&apos;s duration. If the vessel moves out of a &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt;scape, companions left behind can&apos;t return to the vessel by being near the &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt;er. If a companion is killed, its body doesn&apos;t return to the &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt; voyage&lt;/i&gt; unless you carry it with you, just like any other object.  If the &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt;er awakens while the &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt; vessel is still in its &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt;, it can allow the &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt; travel&lt;/i&gt;ers to exit or not (as with &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt; travel&lt;/i&gt;). The &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt; vessel remains intact in the Dimension of Dreams for the spell&apos;s duration even if it&apos;s untethered from a  &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt;. It drifts through &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt;s when this happens, and you can&apos;t pilot it to another &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt; (even a &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt; of the initial &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt;er if that creature begins &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt;ing again). If you dismiss the spell at any time, you and all subjects within the &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt; vessel return to where you started on the Material Plane.  You can increase the number of companions you can bring on a &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt; voyage&lt;/i&gt; to 10 creatures per caster level, though to do so you must increase the casting time, maintaining your concentration and touching up to 6 creatures per round as a full-round action. If your concentration is disrupted before you touch all of the targets, the spell is wasted and has no effect.

If the target fails this saving throw, the tendril is more restrictive, making the target grappled and dealing it 1d6+4 points of bludgeoning damage. Each round when you concentrate to maintain the spell, the snare attempts a grapple combat maneuver check to maintain the grapple. As normal when grappling, the snare gains a +5 bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks against opponents it is already grappling. The snare&apos;s CMB is equal to 6 + your caster level, and its CMD is equal to 16 + your caster level.

You can shrink or extend the snare, but if the distance between you and the target exceeds the spell&apos;s range, the snare disappears. The ectoplasmic tether has hardness 10 and a number of hit points equal to 10 + your caster level + your Constitution modifier, and the tether can be damaged or sundered anywhere along its length. You are not considered to have the grappled condition while tethered to the target.

This doorway takes on any form of your choosing, but can be no larger than a 5-foot cube. This spell has different effects depending on whether you are inside a mindscape when you cast it.  When you cast this spell outside a mindscape, the doorway connects to one mindscape inhabited by a creature of your choice within close range (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 levels) of the door. That creature becomes the door&apos;s conduit, but can attempt a Will save to deny access to the mindscape. You must be aware of the mindscape to connect a &lt;i&gt;mindscape door&lt;/i&gt; to it. If you connect to the mindscape, you designate any number of creatures to be able to see and pass through the door as though it were a normal doorway. You can name specific creatures or categories of creatures, or allow all creatures access. Creatures other than those you designate can&apos;t perceive or use the door, nor can mindless creatures or those immune to mind-affecting effects. Once anyone enters the mindscape through the door, a duplicate of the door appears inside the mindscape next to the creature you used as a conduit. Anyone inside a mindscape is able to perceive and use a &lt;i&gt;mindscape door&lt;/i&gt; within that mindscape. Anyone who enters is subject to all rules of the mindscape, but is aware she is in a mindscape if you informed her where the portal leads.  When you cast this spell inside a mindscape, a duplicate of the door appears next to your body in the real world. The creator of the mindscape can attempt a Will saving throw to prevent you  from creating the door if she is within the mindscape. The two doors operate as if you&apos;d cast the spell outside a mindscape. You still designate who can use the door from the real world to get into the mindscape, but you can&apos;t prevent creatures within the mindscape from exiting to the real world.  Typically, a &lt;i&gt;mindscape door&lt;/i&gt; operates in both directions, but you can create it as a one-way door if you so choose. Unlike with other spells, you can cast this spell as a full-round action while engaged in a psychic duel. This spell can be used to exit a binary mindscape, but not to enter one.

If the target is a spellcaster who must choose and prepare spells in advance, each negative level imposed by &lt;i&gt;mindwipe&lt;/i&gt; also causes the target to lose one prepared spell from her highest level of spells known for each of her spellcasting classes for which she must prepare spells.

The target cannot use the lost spell slots and spells known as long as the corresponding negative levels last. When the target loses a spell known, the spell remains on her class list but she cannot prepare or cast the spell.  If the negative levels from &lt;i&gt;mindwipe&lt;/i&gt; cause the target&apos;s total number of negative levels to equal or exceed her character level, instead of dying, she enters a catatonic state as long as the negative levels from &lt;i&gt;mindwipe&lt;/i&gt; continue to cause her total number of negative levels to equal or exceed her character level.&lt;/p&gt;",Occult Adventures,,"Erase a portion of the target’s mind and experiences, inflicting negative levels.",NULL

Your image moves with a fly speed of 60 feet and perfect maneuverability. Your senses perceive only what the image can see and hear while occupying it, and your own body is considered blind, deaf, and helpless. You can switch between the image and your body as a swift action. While your mind is in your body, the image is similarly helpless.  Your image can pass through solid objects as though you are incorporeal. It cannot go farther into a solid object than  your space (5 feet for a Small or Medium creature). It can&apos;t be damaged by most attacks or effects, whether or not they affect incorporeal creatures. However, mind-affecting effects targeted against or affecting your &lt;i&gt;psychic image&lt;/i&gt; have their full effect on you whenever your mind occupies it.  If you desire, you can cast any psychic spell or spell-like ability with a range of touch or greater while your mind occupies your image. You can&apos;t cast non-psychic spells through the image, even if you possess them. The &lt;i&gt;psychic image&lt;/i&gt; can cast only psychic illusion spells on itself.

This illusion has visual and tactile components. Careful examination of or handling the target grants a saving throw to disbelieve, but casual observation does not. Using a broken object for its intended purpose automatically reveals the deception. Appraise checks to assess the value of an object affected by &lt;i&gt;quintessence&lt;/i&gt; estimate the value as an item of its type in perfect condition, unless the appraiser disbelieves the illusion.

For example, a forest that is home to a tight-knit community of fey might appear as a city in the trees, or a beautiful palace ruled by an evil king and warded by &lt;i&gt;forbiddance&lt;/i&gt; might appear as a dark fortress encased in insubstantial chains.

In addition, the subject immediately receives another saving throw (if one was allowed to begin with) against any spell or effect  that would possess or exercise direct mental control over her. This functions in all respects like the second property of &lt;i&gt;protection from evil&lt;/i&gt; but it applies regardless of the alignment of the creature or object that created the possession or mental influence effect.

When you reach caster level 14th, the glaive gains the &lt;i&gt;spell-storing&lt;/i&gt; weapon special ability. When you reach caster level 17th, it loses the &lt;i&gt;flaming&lt;/i&gt; weapon special ability, and gains the &lt;i&gt;flaming&lt;/i&gt; burst weapon special ability. The glaive&apos;s enhancement bonus increases to +2 at caster level 15th, and +3 at caster level 19th.  If this spell is cast on a magic weapon, the powers of the spell supersede any that the weapon normally has, rendering the normal enhancement bonus and powers of the weapon inoperative for the duration of the spell. This spell is not cumulative with &lt;i&gt;greater magic weapon&lt;/i&gt; or any other spell that might modify the weapon in any way. This spell does not work on artifacts. A masterwork weapon&apos;s bonus on attack rolls does not stack with an enhancement bonus to attack.&lt;/p&gt;",Arcane Anthology,,,NULL

The object must be an alchemical item, but not a dose of disease, a poison, a magic potion, or another type of consumable item. The item divides itself into two nearly identical copies and the newly separated one is delivered into your hand. The new item functions as the original in all ways except the copied item suffers a slight reduction in quality.

Because of its connection to living creatures of the distant past, the spell does not function on outsiders, undead, and summoned creatures. Your target grows to legendary proportions, increasing in size by one category. The creature&apos;s height doubles and its weight increases by a factor of 8. The target gains a +6 size bonus to its Strength score and a +4 size bonus to its Constitution score. It gains a +6 size bonus to its natural armor, and DR 10/adamantine. Its carrying capacity changes to reflect its new size. The creature&apos;s equipment and weapons, if any, also increase in size. Any enlarged item that leaves the creature&apos;s possession returns to its original size (though thrown weapons and ammunition deal damage at their enlarged size before returning to their true proportions).  If insufficient room is available to accommodate the creature&apos;s growth, it attains the maximum possible size and can attempt a Strength check (using its increased Strength score) to burst any  enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it. The spell cannot crush a creature by enclosing it.&lt;/p&gt;",Arcane Anthology,,,200

If the item has magical or alchemical properties, they become inert for the duration of the spell. If you are holding the item when you cast this spell, you can drain it into the bottle used as focus for the spell. Items with hit point damage or the broken condition regain 5 hit points/caster level if drained into a bottle in this way. The duration of temporary effects (such as applied poison or &lt;i&gt;greater magic&lt;/i&gt; weapon) passes normally and may expire while the object is in liquid form. The liquid is clearly unsafe to drink, but if, for some reason, a creature does drink the liquid and the spell ends, the creature takes 3d6 points of damage, and brings up the solid version of the item as a standard action in a coughing fit.  Any spell or effect that would disperse or dilute an object affected by &lt;i&gt;liquefy&lt;/i&gt; forces the object to attempt a Fortitude save (using the effect&apos;s DC, or DC 15 for effects with no saving throws of their own, such as pouring a liquefied object into a stream). A failed save causes the object to gain the broken condition. If the item is already broken, it is instead destroyed on a failed save. &lt;i&gt;Liquefy&lt;/i&gt; has no effect on artifacts, constructs, or intelligent magic items.&lt;/p&gt;",Arcane Anthology,,,NULL

You imbue your weapon with a powerful ability to ward off attacks made against you by the creature that challenged you. You gain a +5 insight bonus to your AC and CMD against the attacks of the initiating creature as long as you hold the weapon. If you release the weapon for any reason, the spell ends.

The object is reduced to 1/4 its normal hit point total, gains the broken condition, and appears damaged and worn. If it grants a numeric bonus, such as a +2 deflection bonus to AC, that bonus is reduced by 1 for every 3 caster levels you possess, to a minimum of +0. Other magical qualities fail to work 50% of the time when called upon, so a resistance bonus on saves or a weapon&apos;s &lt;i&gt;flaming&lt;/i&gt; special ability could fail each time the item is used.  If the object is an intelligent magical item, its Ego score remains unchanged despite its reduced quality. The weapon has only a 50% chance to successfully use any spells or spell-like abilities it has, and has a 25% chance of forgetting its special purpose (if any).

This spell does not prevent subsequent natural decay or spoilage. Unholy water and similar liquids of significance are spoiled by &lt;i&gt;tears to wine&lt;/i&gt;, but the spell has no effect on creatures of any type or on magic potions.

When the subject is first targeted by this spell, and once every 24 hours thereafter, the subject must attempt a Will save in order to disbelieve this effect. If the save succeeds, the spell&apos;s effect ends. The first time the subject fails this save, it must also attempt a Fortitude save. If it also fails this Fortitude save, the subject permanently assumes the form of the chosen animal or humanoid, as per &lt;i&gt;polymorph&lt;/i&gt;. This is a &lt;i&gt;polymorph&lt;/i&gt; effect. Successfully disbelieving the spell returns the subject to its true form. If the subject fails its Fortitude save against the effects of &lt;i&gt;baleful shadow transmutation&lt;/i&gt;, any further &lt;i&gt;polymorph&lt;/i&gt; effects cast on the target automatically fail.  Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to &lt;i&gt;baleful shadow transmutation&lt;/i&gt;, and a creature with the shapechanger subtype can revert to its natural form as a standard action.&lt;/p&gt;",Blood Of Shadows,,,NULL

If the target was forced to perform any actions contrary to his alignment, monk vows, paladin oath, or similar code of conduct by that charm or compulsion effect, that action doesn&apos;t cause him to lose access to class abilities, including divine spellcasting.

In addition, the target animal is temporarily &lt;i&gt;awaken&lt;/i&gt;ed to sentience (as the &lt;i&gt;awaken&lt;/i&gt; spell) for the duration of this spell, and it can use its increased mental acuity to come up with creative solutions to overcome obstacles to delivering its message. The &lt;i&gt;awaken&lt;/i&gt;ed target animal speaks any one language you know. In addition, you can imbue the animal with up to 5 ranks in any of the following skills: Bluff, Diplomacy, Knowledge (local), Knowledge (nobility), Linguistics, or Sense Motive. It treats any of these skills that are class skills for you as class skills. The number of ranks you imbue in any of these skills can&apos;t exceed the target animal&apos;s Hit Dice nor the number of ranks you possess in that skill.  The message you send with your &lt;i&gt;animal ambassador&lt;/i&gt; can be a verbal message, which the &lt;i&gt;awaken&lt;/i&gt;ed target animal can speak using its own voice or deliver using your voice. It can engage in conversation using its own intellect, knowledge, and linguistic abilities. The &lt;i&gt;animal ambassador&lt;/i&gt; is loyal to you, but it is otherwise susceptible to mind-affecting effects like any other creature. You can also send your &lt;i&gt;animal ambassador&lt;/i&gt; with an object or container that is within its physical ability to carry, making it deliver the contents to the target of your intended message. If the object it is given to carry is poisonous, trapped, or otherwise inherently dangerous (even if it would normally be dangerous only to the creature receiving it rather than the animal), or if you or your allies attack the target animal, the &lt;i&gt;animal ambassador&lt;/i&gt; spell fails and the animal becomes hostile toward you. The &lt;i&gt;animal ambassador&lt;/i&gt; intelligently but single-mindedly attempts to deliver the message to its intended target, and you can&apos;t task it with other tasks like fighting, scouting, searching for traps, and so on.

Once the &lt;i&gt;animal ambassador&lt;/i&gt; has located its target and delivered its message (and object, if desired), its enhanced mental abilities fade within 2d6 minutes.

When the spell ends (or when the affected creatures move outside of the range of the emanation), observers see things normally but altered perceptions from the earlier events remain.

Though the feast and all the finery last only 1 hour, creatures that partake remain nourished and sated for 24 hours. Though you have little control over the fine details of the feast, you can specify what type of dish you want for each course and what sorts of beverages are provided.

Additionally, when you use a standard action to concentrate on this spell, you can also study a creature within the spell&apos;s area and attempt a Spellcraft check in order to determine the last spell that the creature cast by identifying lingering traces that the spell left in the caster&apos;s aura. The DC to identify the spell is equal to 20 + the creature&apos;s caster level.  Finally, you are able to locate and analyze the signature flourishes in a magical aura that allow you to match a spell to the person who cast it. In order to find these identifiers in a spell&apos;s aura, you must spend 1 round focusing on that spell in particular, and succeed at an opposed Knowledge (arcana) check against the caster (or a Knowledge [arcana] check with a DC equal to 15 + the spell level if the caster wants her work to be identified and emphasizes these unique elements rather than obscuring them).

The spell can penetrate barriers, but a sheet of lead, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it. A creature&apos;s personal interpretation of its beliefs determines whether or not it is of the same faith as you-hence heretics and splinter cultists of your deity still count as worshipers of that deity. Furthermore, since the spell picks up a creature&apos;s current beliefs and feelings, a creature actively pretending to be a member of the same faith also appears to the spell to be a member.

This spell can hide or create telltale wounds, bruising, and other subtle clues as to the nature of the target&apos;s death, and the final hours leading up to it, allowing you to make the corpse appear to have died in just about any way. You could, for example, make stab wounds close up as though they were never there, rearrange bruises on the neck, evaporate traces of poison within the body into nothingness, make burn marks grow to cover the corpse&apos;s skin, or shrivel the target&apos;s body  as though the creature had starved. This spell can&apos;t hide extreme alterations to the body (such as the loss of a limb), nor can it restore flesh to a skeletal corpse or strip a corpse down to skeletal form. It is also unable to change the apparent identity of the corpse.  Anyone who closely examines the corpse can attempt a Perception check (DC = 10 + your caster level) to notice that the corpse&apos;s wounds (or lack thereof) don&apos;t look natural, but this doesn&apos;t allow the observer to determine what the corpse looked like before this spell was cast.

If you fail to overcome the subject&apos;s spell resistance, the subject&apos;s soul can negate the calling and gain the option to return to life (as &lt;i&gt;resurrection&lt;/i&gt;) in the restored body. The possession otherwise functions (as possessionOA) except that the subject&apos;s soul is not present to resist. When &lt;i&gt;false&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;resurrection&lt;/i&gt; ends or the demon is removed from the subject, the demon returns to the Abyss, leaving the body alive but soulless (like that created by clone).

The spell can be cast at any distance. The difficulty of the save depends on your knowledge of the subject and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that creature. The target gains the same bonuses and penalties on its Will save to resist this spell as the bonuses and penalties that apply to the &lt;i&gt;scrying&lt;/i&gt; spell (including a +5 bonus if the target is on another plane).  The illusion created by the spell moves with the target, and is not stationary. The image can affect the way the target is perceived, the way the target&apos;s surroundings are perceived, and the way that specific creatures or objects around the target are perceived. For the target, and any other specific creatures or objects you specify, you can cause them to appear as other creatures or objects that you designate, not to appear at all, or to have their appearance unaltered. For the target&apos;s surroundings, you can choose to make the target appear to be somewhere else, either a specific location with which you are familiar, or a generic location conjured from your imagination. You can change the way that the spell affects the appearance of any of these things by concentrating on the spell. You can also cause creatures or objects to appear in the illusion that are not really there, or to make a creature or object seem to act in a way other than it is actually acting. In this case, you must concentrate on the spell, or these aspects of the illusion simply remain static. The spell can provide visual, auditory, olfactory, tactile, and thermal sensations as needed.

You link the intangible item to the target&apos;s flesh by making a brand shaped like the item on the target&apos;s skin. The intangible item merges with the target&apos;s flesh and is contained within the target&apos;s body, moving with the target wherever it goes. The creature can retrieve the item or reabsorb it as a full-round action, and can do so as many times as it wants. When worn or wielded by the target, the item regains its solidity and functions normally, though the target can&apos;t drop or remove the item (other than by using the full-round action), nor can it be disarmed or stolen. If the item is destroyed, the spell ends. If the &lt;i&gt;ghost brand&lt;/i&gt; spell is dispelled while the object is inside the target&apos;s body,  the object bursts out of the target&apos;s flesh, dealing 3d6 points of piercing and slashing damage to the target that bypasses DR, as well as 1d6 points of bleed damage.&lt;/p&gt;",Ultimate Intrigue,,Allow an item to transform into a brand and back.,10

When they are in your presence, the insects obey your mental commands, and you can issue orders to any number of them as a single standard action, provided that you issue the same orders to each one. In order to issue different orders to different insects, you must spend a separate standard action for each set of orders. An insect in physical contact with you can answer simple questions about what it has observed, at a rate of one question per round. It can relate only what it perceived with its senses, and can&apos;t repeat speech. It has difficulty making subjective judgments, and questions that demand such reasoning are unlikely to yield a clear answer. For example, an insect is unable to relay someone&apos;s emotional state or determine who among several people it saw might be in charge.  Each insects&apos; size is Fine. Each insect has 1 hit point, AC 20 (+2 Dexterity, +8 size), a movement speed of 5 feet, a climb speed of 5 feet, and a fly speed of 20 feet (perfect maneuverability). The insects use your saving throw bonuses, have a total Perception skill bonus equal to 5 + 1/2 your caster level, and can&apos;t make attacks. Due to their incredibly small size and magical nature, they can make Stealth checks to avoid being noticed even if they lack a source of cover or concealment, and they have a total Stealth skill bonus equal to 18 + 1/2 your caster level. The insects can even climb onto creatures of Tiny or larger size while using Stealth, possibly riding on those creatures unnoticed. A Tiny creature gains a +16 bonus on Perception checks made to notice one of these insects currently climbing on it. For each size category larger than Tiny the creature being climbed is, this bonus is reduced by 4 (to a minimum of +0 for Huge or larger creatures).  You also maintain a faint mystical connection with these insects, which allows you to sense where they are.

The illusion appears to be a perfect replica. Actively examining the fake with an Appraise or Perception check grants a creature a Will save, but on a failed saving throw, it concludes that the fake is the genuine article. The illusion isn&apos;t a functional item, nor does it have any magical properties of the original. For example, an &lt;i&gt;instant fake&lt;/i&gt; of a set of thieves&apos; tools can&apos;t be used to pick a lock, a false warhammer can&apos;t harm a person or break an object, a suit of unreal chainmail offers no actual protection, and an illusory &lt;i&gt;potion of cure light wounds&lt;/i&gt; doesn&apos;t heal any hit points when imbibed.&lt;/p&gt;",Ultimate Intrigue,,Provide a short-term replica of an object.,NULL

The target treats her number of ranks in Knowledge (nobility) as though it were equal to your number of ranks in Knowledge (nobility), to a maximum of 5 ranks and a minimum of 0.

The target doesn&apos;t attempt a saving throw when initially exposed to the &lt;i&gt;languid venom&lt;/i&gt;, but instead saves at the end of the poison&apos;s onset time. If the poison is neutralized or otherwise cured prior to the end of its onset time, it is rendered harmless.

By default, the spell targets every creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or greater that is within the spell&apos;s range, but at your discretion, you can choose to restrict the spell to certain creatures, causing it to either only deliver its message to creatures meeting a certain criteria, or to deliver it to all creatures except those meeting that criteria. The criteria must be something objective and observable. For example, you could cause the mage&apos;s decree to reach only creatures of a certain race. You can&apos;t choose recipients that rely on unobservable information, such as creatures of a certain alignment or of a particular class.  You can&apos;t pick and choose individual creatures to target or exclude. While the spell&apos;s range defaults to 1 mile per caster level, you can choose to reduce it to a smaller radius, although the spell&apos;s area can&apos;t be shaped.  The nature of the spell prevents the message it carries from having any magical power; the message can&apos;t be used to transmit spells or abilities that are conveyed via speech. The message is transmitted in your voice in whatever language you use to speak it, and is not automatically translated.

If you choose to make the creature register as being the subject of one or more spells, you can also alter the unique spellcasting identifiers of those spell auras, in the same fashion as described for objects.  If the target is a creature, you can also alter how the creature registers to &lt;i&gt;arcane sight&lt;/i&gt;, making the creature appear to have or not have spellcasting or spell-like abilities, whether those abilities are arcane, divine, or psychic in nature, and the strength of the most powerful spell or spell-like ability they currently have available for use. Similarly, you can alter the way the target appears when viewed with &lt;i&gt;greater &lt;i&gt;detect&lt;/i&gt; magic&lt;/i&gt;, causing the last spell that he cast to seem to be any spell of your choice.&lt;/p&gt;",Ultimate Intrigue,,"As magic aura, but also affects creatures and allows more options.",NULL

Alternatively, you can compare dissimilar items and know if they have a potential relationship. For instance, you can compare a creature&apos;s tooth against a bite mark and know if that creature could have caused the bite mark.  This spell is not infallible-an identical match can result from comparing items or creatures that are duplicates of one another.

Once sheathed or slung in this way, the weapon is difficult to draw, as previously noted above. Unattended weapons that are not currently sheathed or slung are anchored in place by the spell, and require a successful Strength check to pick up; each attempt requires a standard action.

She takes a permanent -4 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks for 1 hour per caster level. After her save to disbelieve, the target attempts a second Will save to negate this effect.  &lt;i&gt;Poison&lt;/i&gt;: The target believes she has been poisoned. Choose a physical ability score. Each round for 6 rounds, plus 1 round per 5  caster levels, the target takes 1d3 points of damage to the chosen ability score.

If the target fails the initial save to negate the curse, every day that it spends in a settlement, it must attempt a Will save. If it fails, it accidentally says or does something that makes others assume the rumor you specified is true in some way that is unflattering or incriminating. If the creature is not aware of the nature of the rumors, it takes a -4 penalty on these secondary saves. After the first failed save, the attitude each resident in the settlement has regarding the target is worsened by one step. For each additional failure, the target becomes the victim of focused harassment. A group of residents taunts or attacks the creature, potentially sending the authorities to investigate if the rumor indicates criminal guilt.  The spell can be cast at any distance.

Any furniture or other mundane fixtures function normally for anyone inside the mansion, but cease to exist if taken beyond its walls. No fixture created with this spell can create magical effects, but magical devices brought into the mansion function normally.

You can follow the rumor&apos;s path until you reach a creature that heard the rumor but didn&apos;t repeat it (or repeated it incorrectly). The glow identifies only creatures who heard the same information you conveyed. Minor cosmetic changes in the rumor don&apos;t interrupt the chain, but when the rumor no longer resembles the information you imparted, the trail stops and the spell ends.  You can instead use this spell to trace a rumor back to its source once you hear it. In this case, you repeat the rumor as you heard it for the spell&apos;s verbal component. The person who told you the rumor can attempt a Will save to end the effect. Failure indicates the silver glow leads to the individual that told her. This process continues each time you locate the next individual spreading the same information. Each individual attempts the save until one of them succeeds (in which case the spell ends and you can&apos;t attempt to trace this particular rumor again) or you trace the rumor to its original source.

Each round it removes an item as determined randomly from the following slots: belt, body, chest, eyes, feet, hands, head, headband, shoulders, or wrists. When determining randomly, don&apos;t include any slots if the character has no item of that sort, and don&apos;t include items that take more than one move action to remove. Though creatures can&apos;t have more than one magic item in any of those slots, they can have multiple mundane items that fit each slot, in which case randomly decide which one they remove. If a target is wearing clothing that doesn&apos;t fit in any of those slots, such as breeches or a quiver, add it to the list of possibilities at the GM&apos;s discretion.  The target regards the discarded items with revulsion, and if forced to touch such an item (such as with a melee or ranged touch attack using the item as an improvised weapon), the target becomes sickened for 1d3 rounds. Other than the move action to remove items, the character can take whatever actions it chooses.&lt;/p&gt;",Ultimate Intrigue,,Force target to remove equipment.,NULL

Swallow Poison,transmutation,,,"alchemist 5, druid 5, shaman 5, witch 5",1 standard action,"V, S, DF",personal,,,you,1 hour/level or until discharged,,,"&lt;p&gt;A special gland grows on the inside of your throat, which absorbs any poisons that you ingest, and can be used to expel them in a toxic spray. Any time you consume ingested poison during the spell&apos;s duration, you can roll a caster level check against the poison&apos;s save DC in order to harmlessly absorb the poison, ignoring its effects. The spell can absorb up to 1 dose of poison per 3 caster levels, after which the gland is unable to process any more poison, and any further doses of ingested poison affect you normally.  You store each dose of absorbed poison within the gland, and you can end the spell to spray one dose of absorbed poison out of your mouth as a standard action. This sprays the poison in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must succeed at a Reflex save (at &lt;i&gt;swallow&lt;/i&gt; poison&apos;s DC) or be exposed to the sprayed poison, which is treated as though it were a contact poison for this purpose. Everything about the poison other than its type, including its frequency, effect, and saving throw DC, are unaffected by this spell.

If she is in the midst of another situation as vital as protecting her darkest secret, such as combat, this doesn&apos;t cause her to cease participating, but otherwise, she becomes compelled to use her abilities and skills to determine exactly how much the other individual knows. Even if she isn&apos;t around other creatures or otherwise avoids confronting her paranoia for a time, the nagging fear causes the target to become shaken for the duration of the spell (though this doesn&apos;t stack with other fear effects to make the target frightened or panicked).  The subject&apos;s paranoia increases over time, forcing her to take additional steps to protect herself from the other creature. Depending on her personality (or subject to the GM&apos;s discretion), she might confess, publicly demand to know what the other creature knows, attack the other creature to silence it, or offer the other creature a bribe.

If you do, you can attempt a caster level check (DC = 11 + the &lt;i&gt;teleport&lt;/i&gt;ation effect&apos;s caster level), taking a -5 penalty if the effect occurred more than 1 minute ago. If you succeed, you gain a glimpse of the &lt;i&gt;teleport&lt;/i&gt;ation effect&apos;s termination point (if you detected an origin point) or origin point (if you detected a termination point). This glimpse lasts long enough for you to get a brief look at the area, but not long enough to scrutinize it in detail. It doesn&apos;t come with any geographic knowledge of the location, so it is not sufficient for &lt;i&gt;teleport&lt;/i&gt; or similar magic.

Once the wasp swarm has built its nest, this spell also wards the area. As per &lt;i&gt;alarm&lt;/i&gt;, when intruders that do not speak the password pass within 20 feet, the swarm is alerted and immediately leaves its nest and attacks the nearest intruder. The swarm pursues that intruder as best it can. Once the swarm attacks an intruder, you have no control over its target or direction of travel.

The target treats all other living creatures as if it were friendly toward them. Any overtly hostile or harmful act toward the target by any living creature ends the spell.  An inveigled creature attempts to fulfill multiple requests in the same manner as it would favors for its true friends.

The target corpse must be fresh-either dead for no more than 24 hours or appropriately preserved by an effect such as &lt;i&gt;gentle repose&lt;/i&gt;. While casting the spell, you must remain in contact with the corpse while touching the living target with the focus item. As the spell is cast, the dead body&apos;s flesh unravels like ribbons to sheathe the living target, who must be within one size category of the corpse. While the spell is in effect, the focus item must remain within 30 feet of the target living creature.  The living target gains the physical appearance and size of the corpse, and gains its abilities as defined in &lt;i&gt;alter self&lt;/i&gt; as well as any immunities, weapon proficiencies, weaknesses, and spell resistance the dead target had while living. The living target gains a +20 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate the individual whose corpse is targeted by this spell. The disguise created by &lt;i&gt;recorporeal incarnation&lt;/i&gt; lasts for a number of weeks equal to your caster level, or until the focus item is moved more than 30 feet away from the living target. When the effect ends, the living target returns to its normal form, sloughing off the corpse&apos;s flesh.  The greatest strength of &lt;i&gt;recorporeal incarnation&lt;/i&gt; is the difficulty of detecting it as a disguise. If subjected to &lt;i&gt;detect magic&lt;/i&gt;, the living target sheds no magical aura, though the focus item gives off an aura of strong necromantic magic. &lt;i&gt;True seeing&lt;/i&gt; does not reveal the living target&apos;s true form, since the corpse&apos;s flesh magically obscures it. The spell &lt;i&gt;detect undead&lt;/i&gt; and similar effects indicate the living target is an undead creature, but the target is not truly undead, and is not affected by any other effects that target undead creatures. &lt;i&gt;Recorporeal incarnation&lt;/i&gt; does not disguise the target&apos;s alignment.  If the living target of &lt;i&gt;recorporeal incarnation&lt;/i&gt; dies while the spell is in effect, the spell continues. Any &lt;i&gt;raise dead&lt;/i&gt; or similar spell cast upon that target resurrects that target, not the corpse flesh. Since &lt;i&gt;recorporeal incarnation&lt;/i&gt; destroys the majority of the target corpse&apos;s physical remains, the target corpse cannot be restored to life except by &lt;i&gt;miracle&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;resurrection&lt;/i&gt;, true &lt;i&gt;resurrection&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;wish&lt;/i&gt;.  &lt;i&gt;Recorporeal incarnation&lt;/i&gt; can be made permanent by a 15th-level caster using &lt;i&gt;permanency&lt;/i&gt; with a material component worth 17,500 gp.&lt;/p&gt;",Inner Sea Intrigue,,,250

Each target that fails a Fortitude save becomes cursed with a wasting sickness. The disease has no onset period, and those who contracted it must attempt a second Fortitude save immediately. A target that fails this second saving throw takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage and 1d6 points of Charisma damage. Every day thereafter, each target that was within 100 feet of another target during the previous 24 hours takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage and 1d6 points of Charisma damage (reroll to determine the specific amount of damage each day). A successful Fortitude save negates the damage for that day only.  A target cannot be healed of damage from this disease (naturally or by magic) while the target is within 100 feet of another target. If healed of such damage while away from other targets, a target might take damage again the day they reconvene. This disease is a curse, and can never be cured by successful saving throws.

Each round, the shadows attempt a Perception check on the squares they touch with a total bonus equal to your caster level + your Charisma or Intelligence modifier, whichever is higher. You can move the shadows up to 30 feet or change the search criteria as part of concentrating on the spell. Whenever the shadows come into contact with a creature with spell resistance, you must attempt a caster level check to overcome its spell resistance. If you fail, the spell ends.  When the shadows locate a desired item or creature, you are aware of its shape and size and can order the shadows to try to seize it. If the shadows are seeking a creature, the area they cover becomes difficult terrain for that creature, and the creature must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or become entangled and unable to move. Changing the criteria of the creature or object sought or moving the shadows away from an entangled target frees it.

Your scouts must spend 1d6 hours investigating the target location, but need no oversight. When done, they return unerringly to you with their findings, traveling up to 1 mile per caster level you have to rejoin their master. Each insect&apos;s size is Fine. Each insect has 1 hit point, AC 20 (+2 Dexterity, +8 size), a movement speed of 5 feet, a climb speed of 5 feet, and a fly speed of 20 feet (perfect maneuverability). The insects use your saving throw bonuses, have a total Perception skill bonus equal to 5 + 1/2 your caster level, and can&apos;t attack. Because of their incredibly small size and magical nature, they can attempt Stealth checks to avoid being noticed even if they lack a source of cover or concealment, and they have a total Stealth skill bonus equal to 18 + 1/2 your caster level.  Each scout that returns passes along memories of specific structural flaws, defenses, and alarms, granting you the ability to reroll one failed skill check per scout, as long as the skill check involves that specific location&apos;s layout, such as a Stealth check to sneak in, a Disable Device check to silence an alarm, or a Perception check to notice a trap. If even one scout returns, you also gain a rough understanding of the building&apos;s layout (at least, any portions your scouts could access). All insight (and the associated rerolls) fades 1 hour per caster level you have after the scouts return. Your insects remember nothing about creatures, and so provide no information about guardians or any conversations they may overhear.&lt;/p&gt;",Spymaster&apos;s Handbook,,,NULL

This spell binds a single creature into a prepared book, sustaining it in suspended animation and filling the book with its experience and knowledge. The tome weighs 10 pounds and has one page for every day of the subject&apos;s life. The cover and binding transform to reflect the subject&apos;s appearance, interests, and tastes. Every thought and memory-including those the target may have forgotten long ago-are perfectly transcribed within the enchanted pages, penned in excruciating detail in the language that the creature was thinking or speaking in when the event occurred. If a memory includes dialogue in a language the subject didn&apos;t understand, that dialogue is reproduced phonetically, and must be translated by a reader who knows that language. Any alterations to a subject&apos;s memories-such as by a &lt;i&gt;modify memory&lt;/i&gt; spell-appear in a subtly different script; a successful DC 35 Linguistics check is needed to identify this.  Spells that modify or remove text-such as &lt;i&gt;erase&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;secret page&lt;/i&gt;-also affect the target&apos;s memory if they persist after its release. &lt;i&gt;Modify memory&lt;/i&gt; can be used to repair any changes to its original state, or alter the accounts recorded within the book. A creature imprisoned by scribe&apos;s binding automatically fails any saving throws against effects to change or modify its memories.  A target bound by this spell can be freed by only &lt;i&gt;freedom&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;miracle&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;wish&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Polymorph any object&lt;/i&gt; restores the target&apos;s normal form for 24 hours. Scribe&apos;s binding makes the imprisoning tome supernaturally durable (hardness 20, 10 hp per HD the imprisoned creature had).

Effects that impose fear conditions become objects of ridicule, with the targets making fun of the source of the object as it attempts to scare them.  &lt;i&gt;Absurdity&lt;/i&gt; protects your targets from gaining lesser fear conditions (spooked, shaken, and scared), granting them immunity to spooked and a 50% chance to negate shaken or scared conditions instead of gaining them from any effect, including uses of the Intimidate skill to demoralize. Any other effect related to a spell or ability that generates fear (such as dying from a &lt;i&gt;phantasmal&lt;/i&gt; killer) affects them normally, and effects that ignore immunity to fear also ignore &lt;i&gt;absurdity&lt;/i&gt;.  However, target creatures also have serious difficulty noticing potential threats; they take a -10 penalty on Sense Motive checks to avoid surprise or to notice that a creature is actively threatening or malicious and a -2 penalty on initiative checks. The spell doesn&apos;t prevent spells or effects that provide early warning or a form of danger sense (like &lt;i&gt;anticipate&lt;/i&gt; perilUM or &lt;i&gt;find&lt;/i&gt; traps) from alerting the affected character to danger.&lt;/p&gt;",Horror Adventures,, Threats seem like a ridiculous farce.,NULL

This spell has two purposes, and you choose which application to use at the time of casting.  &lt;i&gt;Combat Corruption&lt;/i&gt;: Each time a creature fails a saving throw to prevent its corruption from progressing (as described in that  corruption&apos;s Progression section), it advances to the next corruption stage-at stage 3, it loses the battle against its corruption. Using this spell can lower the target&apos;s corruption stage by 1. This has no effect if the target isn&apos;t at progression stage of 1 or higher.  &lt;i&gt;Remove Corruption&lt;/i&gt;: You can remove 1 manifestation level from the target creature, as well as the most recently acquired manifestation and its corresponding gift and stain. Doing this also reduces the power of gifts and stains that vary based upon manifestation level. This application of &lt;i&gt;alleviate corruption&lt;/i&gt; doesn&apos;t reduce the target&apos;s corruption stage. If the target creature loses all manifestation levels, it is cured of the corruption.  Either application of the spell requires a caster level check. The DC is equal to 10 + double the target&apos;s manifestation level + 3 times the target&apos;s corruption stage (effectively 0, 3, or 6, since stage 3 removes the character from player control).  Tampering with corruptions is dangerous, as their nature is contagious. If you fail this caster level check by 5 or more, you contract the corruption and gain a manifestation (the rules for the useful and vile corruption variants still apply). A roll of natural 1 on the caster level check is an automatic failure. If you already have the same corruption, you must instead attempt an immediate saving throw against it. Casting &lt;i&gt;alleviate corruption&lt;/i&gt; on yourself automatically fails, as does casting it on a target who has fully succumbed to a corruption (failed three saving throws against it). A creature can be the beneficiary of this spell only once per week, whether it succeeds or not.&lt;/p&gt;",Horror Adventures,, Attempt to weaken a corruption’s effect at risk to yourself.,500

You can target a number of undead creatures whose total number of Hit Dice is no greater than twice your caster level. When you create the illusion, you choose the races, genders, and attire for the undead creatures. Additionally, the illusion makes the undead creatures&apos; movements appear lifelike (two shuffling zombies could be made to appear as two strolling lovers). The illusion doesn&apos;t create smell, sound, texture, or temperature. Undead with Intelligence scores can attempt a saving throw to negate the effect of the spell, but mindless undead do not. Any creatures interacting with the illusion receive a saving throw to disbelieve the illusion.  The illusion interferes with &lt;i&gt;detect undead&lt;/i&gt;, requiring the caster to succeed at a caster check (DC = 11 + your caster level) for the spell to determine the creatures are undead.  &lt;i&gt;Appearance of life&lt;/i&gt; can be made permanent with a &lt;i&gt;permanency&lt;/i&gt; spell by a caster of 12th level or higher for the cost of 10,000 gp.&lt;/p&gt;",Horror Adventures,, Undead appear to be alive.,NULL

You assume the exact form of a deceased Small or Medium creature of the humanoid type. Your voice changes to match that of the form you assume. The creature whose form you assume must be dead and you must have access to its fresh corpse (either dead less than 24 hours, or preserved via &lt;i&gt;gentle repose&lt;/i&gt; or similar effect). Any attempt to copy the form of a living creature causes the spell to fail. You do not have access to the assumed form&apos;s abilities, memories, mannerisms, or speech patterns.

You can have the chain either make a melee attack (dealing 1d6 points of slashing damage) or attempt a trip combat maneuver against the target. The chain uses your base attack bonus plus your key spellcasting ability score modifier as its attack bonus and combat maneuver bonus. On a successful hit or combat maneuver check, the target must attempt a Will save. If it fails its save, the creature is shaken for 1d4 rounds. You summon one additional chain every 3 levels after 1st, for a total of two chains at 4th level, three at 7th level, and a maximum of four at 10th level.

If neither creature successfully saves against the spell, the second target also takes any damage conferred to the hostage, provided both are still alive, to a maximum of 10 points of damage per caster level per day (damage beyond that necessary to kill the first target does not transfer). This transferred damage is typeless and ignores the second creature&apos;s damage reduction and resistances. If either target succeeds at the saving throw, you can never attempt to exploit the connection between these particular two creatures again. The connection between your targets weakens when the two are less familiar with one another. Each target gains a +2 bonus on its save if the two are distant relations or related by marriage.

This has a variety of effects depending on whether the target is living or undead.  A living creature has its skeleton rattle within its flesh, causing it grievous harm. The target takes 3d6 points of damage, plus 1d6 additional points of damage per 2 caster levels you have.  In addition, you can move the target 5 feet. This movement doesn&apos;t provoke attacks of opportunity. A successful saving throw halves the damage and negates the movement.  An undead creature takes no damage. Instead, you manipulate the undead, forcing it to take an immediate action to either move up to its speed (provoking attacks of opportunity as normal) or make a single attack against a creature of your choice in its reach. Either of these is the most basic version of the action the creature can take (it doesn&apos;t activate any special abilities that it could apply to the movement or attack, such as grab).

You temporarily gain any stains and gifts that corruption grants to the creature, and the creature retains them. If the gifts have limited uses, you count as having no uses remaining. You take 1d3 points of Wisdom drain whenever you cast this spell.

Anyone entering the area must attempt a Will save or be sickened for 1d6 rounds. This is a mind-affecting effect. If a creature succeeds at its save, it can see the semi-real nature of the illusion.  The room itself is covered in a layer of slippery, semi-real gore. Any creature attempting to walk within or through the area of gore can move at half normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means it can&apos;t move that round, and failure by 5 or more means it falls prone (see the Acrobatics skill for details).

You take 1d4 points of Wisdom drain when you begin the speech and can&apos;t reduce or prevent this damage in any way. Each intelligent creature in the spell&apos;s area takes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage as their perceptions of reality realign with yours for the spell&apos;s duration. Listeners with at least 5 HD can attempt a Will save to negate the effects. Your targets view you with a friendly attitude and respond to criticism of you with irritation. Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate checks to create doubt about your purpose in those affected by the spell take a -4 penalty. The attitude of your targets regarding any creature that criticizes you or your vision automatically changes one step toward hostile; a Diplomacy check that fails by 5 or more reduces their attitude further. Your targets retain the same alignment and their prior beliefs, in addition to the ones you force on them. You can&apos;t force  beliefs on a target if such beliefs would be necessarily against the nature of its alignment and prior beliefs, but targets are otherwise able to hold contradictory beliefs.

This spell can&apos;t contact creatures with more than 6 Hit Dice. You can&apos;t send a specific message, but this spell (and all similar &lt;i&gt;contact entity&lt;/i&gt; spells) can be characterized as an open invitation to make contact and establish communication. If there is an appropriate entity within range, the spell succeeds automatically. You don&apos;t know whether the message was received, nor any specific details about what creatures received it or how many. Creatures that receive the message know the location and distance from where the spell was cast. Because this spell doesn&apos;t  call or summon the target, the target must have its own way to reach the place where the spell was cast.  How creatures respond to a contact spell is circumstantial and it is possible the creatures will simply ignore the spell. Creatures that come and investigate do so in their own time. They usually arrive cautiously, aware of the potential for ambush. Targets of the spell might inform their organization or community if they have one. There are no restrictions on how the creatures react to being contacted, and they might respond with hostility, parley, entertain an alliance, or subjugate the caster and their related community. Using this spell counts as mentally contacting the creature for the purpose of any of its special abilities (such as the star-spawn&apos;s overwhelming mind). For the purpose of spells like &lt;i&gt;scrying&lt;/i&gt;, the creature has firsthand knowledge of you and a connection similar to if it possessed a likeness of you.  Each type of creature requires a different material component that must be included when casting the spell, as shown on Table 4-1: Contact Entity on page 112.

A target with 200 or fewer hit points remaining that fails its saving throw is instantly reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to your caster level or its Constitution score - 1, whichever is less negative. The creature is staggered until the beginning of your next turn, at which point it dies. If the affected creature receives a &lt;i&gt;regenerate&lt;/i&gt; spell before the beginning of your next turn, the creature gains the normal benefits of that spell and, thanks to its heart&apos;s regeneration, it doesn&apos;t immediately die when your next turn begins.

A target with 201 or more hit points that fails its saving throw manages to keep its heart from leaping out of its chest, but it is still staggered for 1 minute and takes 1d4 points of Constitution drain and 1d4 points of Constitution bleed.

The target is blind so long as she has no head, but she gains blindsense to a distance of 15 feet. The target hears normally even without its head.  While detached, the target&apos;s head appears to be dead. The target can&apos;t see through its eyes or hear events around the head. The target&apos;s body knows the direction and distance to its head. Without additional protection, the severed head has AC 7, hardness 5, and 10 hit points.

It rises as a zombie (&lt;i&gt;Pathfinder RPG Bestiary&lt;/i&gt; 288) that is magically tethered to you and obeys your commands. As noted in &lt;i&gt;animate dead&lt;/i&gt;, you can&apos;t control more than 4 HD per caster level worth of undead in total, nor can a single casting create more than 2 HD per caster level.  This spell disguises the zombie&apos;s appearance and allows you to control it. The zombie&apos;s outward appearance, movement, and voice appear the same as if it were still alive. The zombie&apos;s normal staggered condition doesn&apos;t apply (though it can still be staggered by other means). Successfully detecting the &lt;i&gt;flesh puppet&lt;/i&gt; as a zombie without magic requires an opposed Perception check against your Disguise check, and you add your caster level as a bonus on this Disguise check.  An ephemeral string connects you to the zombie. Through this string, you have a mental link to the zombie and can command it as a swift action. The zombie uses its own actions to complete your commands. The zombie can speak up to 25 words in 1 round, but you must mentally impart what you intend it to say as a swift action. It is incapable of articulating speech on its own. The zombie can be ordered to perform very simple tasks it knew in life but can&apos;t make attacks, cast spells, or perform complex or difficult tasks requiring constant concentration.  The string connecting you and the zombie is nearly invisible. A DC 30 Perception check is required to detect it. It has hardness 0 and 1 hp. The length of string you can create is 100 feet + 10 feet per caster level you have. The string snaps if you and the zombie move farther apart than this length, though the zombie won&apos;t move out of range unless forced to do so or unless you command it to do so. If the string to the zombie is severed, the spell immediately ends. The ephemeral string can pass through  physical barriers, but not barriers of magical force, and it can be damaged as though it were a physical object.  When this spell ends, the zombie immediately reverts back to a normal corpse.

As noted in &lt;i&gt;animate dead&lt;/i&gt;, you can&apos;t control more than 4 HD per caster level worth of undead in total, nor can a single casting create more than 2 HD per caster level. A separate string attaches to each zombie in your horde. Severing a zombie&apos;s string reverts that zombie to a corpse, but doesn&apos;t end the spell for other zombies. Because commanding a &lt;i&gt;flesh puppet&lt;/i&gt; requires a swift action, you can issue commands to only one zombie per round, though zombies you previously commanded continue to follow their orders. Likewise, you can command only one zombie to speak per round.  Unlike with &lt;i&gt;flesh puppet&lt;/i&gt;, you can command a zombie to attack.

The wall inserts itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall can&apos;t be created so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. The wall must be vertical, but can be shaped as you see fit.  The wall is considered to be undead. It uses your Will saving throw to resist channel energy.  A &lt;i&gt;flesh wall&lt;/i&gt; is 2 feet thick. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 12 hit points and DR 5/slashing. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. As a move action, you can cause the fleshwall to constrict, shrinking it by a 5-foot square to fill the hole. Additionally, as a standard action, you can cause a 5-foot square of  the wall to permanently detach, forming a human zombie (&lt;i&gt;Bestiary&lt;/i&gt; 288) under your verbal control (this zombie doesn&apos;t count against your normal limit of commanded undead). The zombie reverts back into a normal corpse when the spell&apos;s effect ends. Each 5-foot square of the wall makes a single slam attack against an adjacent enemy on your turn, as a human zombie. The squares of the wall threaten their adjacent squares and can even provide flanking.  Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a Strength check as a full-round action. The DC to move through the wall is equal to 15 + your caster level. A creature that fails the check is trapped in the wall, takes 3d6 points of crushing damage, and is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC against the wall&apos;s slam attack. The creature can make an attempt to escape the wall on its next turn.  You can use zombies already under your control as the material components for a &lt;i&gt;flesh wall&lt;/i&gt;.

The corpse does not provoke attacks of opportunity.  Attempt a special combat maneuver check against the chosen creature. Your CMB for this combat maneuver is equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. If you chose to trip the creature, it falls prone if you equal or exceed its CMD. If you chose to grapple, the  creature gains the grappled condition until it breaks free from the corpse.

You must succeed at a melee touch attack to infect the target. If the target succeeds at its Fortitude saving throw, it takes 1d4 points of ability damage to each physical ability score (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution) and the spell ends. If the target fails its saving throw, it takes 1d4 points of ability damage to each physical ability score immediately and continues to take 1d4 points of ability damage to each of its physical ability scores every day, until the spell expires. It can&apos;t recover this ability damage as long as the spell lasts, even with magic. While the spell continues, the target takes on physical plant characteristics as appropriate to the environment. It begins to diminish in height and its skin turns plantlike. For example, the target&apos;s skin might turn &lt;i&gt;green&lt;/i&gt; and its hair is slowly replaced with grass or leaves or the target&apos;s skin might become smooth, pale, and flabby as the creature transforms into a large mushroom in an underground environment.  If the damage to any single ability score equals or exceeds that score, the target fully transforms into a normal small tree or shrub. This final transformation is instantaneous, ending &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;green&lt;/i&gt; caress&lt;/i&gt;. The target remains alive but is considered the same as a regular tree, shrub, or other vegetation. Any ability damage from other sources, like poison or disease, also applies toward transforming the creature. If the target retains at least 1 point in all of its physical ability scores at the end of 7 days, the final transformation doesn&apos;t occur and the spell ends. Any changes in appearance gradually reverse themselves as the ability damage heals.  &lt;i&gt;Break enchantment&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;dispel magic&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;remove curse&lt;/i&gt; can end the spell before the duration expires, but the spell is contagious. If a caster level check attempt to remove &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;green&lt;/i&gt; caress&lt;/i&gt; fails by 5 or more, the creature who attempted to remove the effect must attempt a Fortitude saving throw as if it had just been targeted with the spell. If the spell&apos;s target attempts to remove the effect from itself and fails, it causes the spell to behave as if affected by &lt;i&gt;plant growth&lt;/i&gt; (as described below).  &lt;i&gt;Polymorph any object&lt;/i&gt; ends the spell and totally restores the target without any risk to the caster, even after the target has been finally transformed, as do &lt;i&gt;limited &lt;i&gt;wish&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;miracle&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;wish&lt;/i&gt; (treat &lt;i&gt;polymorph any object&lt;/i&gt; as if it had an instantaneous duration if it is used in this way).

The weapon averts and deflects attacks, granting you a +1 deflection bonus to AC for each weapon summoned (maximum +5 at 18th level). As a standard action, you can grasp a weapon and throw it as a ranged attack at any target you can see within 30 feet of you (even if it&apos;s a type of weapon that can&apos;t normally be thrown). On a successful hit, the weapon deals 2d6 points of force damage to the target.

The javelin deals 1d6 points of damage to an evil creature on a successful attack; it dissipates harmlessly against creatures of any other alignment. Each time a creature starts its turn while impaled by the javelin, it takes another 1d6 points of damage. For every 4 caster levels you have, the javelin remains in the creature for an additional round (to a maximum of 5 rounds at 18th level). While the creature remains impaled, it takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and skill checks. As a move action, the creature (or another adjacent creature)  can attempt to pull the javelin out (causing it to immediately disappear) with a DC 12 Strength check.  The &lt;i&gt;holy javelin&lt;/i&gt; glows like a torch, and this light clearly indicates the impaled creature&apos;s location, even if it turns invisible.

In addition, the first time a creature that failed its initial saving throw destroys one of the images, it must succeed at a Will save or its perception of the double shifts at the last second.

This spell targets only creatures with the ooze type, creatures with the amorphous special ability, and non-bipedal creatures with a special association with the Outer Gods. This music draws the targets&apos; attention to the caster, as per the fascinate bardic performance. It affects mindless creatures despite the mindless quality typically granting immunity to mind-affecting effects, though it doesn&apos;t ignore any other immunity to mind-affecting effects the creature might have. The caster doesn&apos;t have to maintain the effect each round-the music continues for the duration of the spell. Creatures fascinated by mad sultan&apos;s melody become immune to any other casting of the spell for 24 hours after the spell ends, and the spell ends if the fascination breaks on any of its targets for any reason (such as an attack).  If you have the bardic performance class feature and the fascinate bardic performance, you can choose to use the spell&apos;s saving throw DC or a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 your levels in the class that grants you bardic performance + your Charisma modifier, whichever is higher. If you choose to use the latter DC, each round of the melody costs 1 round of bardic performance and it counts as an active performance for determining how many performances you can have active.

The creature must succeed at a Will save or become frightened for 2d4 rounds. This is a fear effect. A frightened creature can still attempt Intelligence checks to escape the &lt;i&gt;maze&lt;/i&gt;, but it takes 3d6 points of slashing and piercing damage from the trees&apos; branches.  &lt;i&gt;Hellscape&lt;/i&gt;: The creature navigates a landscape of fire and stone walls carved with diabolical faces while the cries of the damned echo in the air.

The target doesn&apos;t heal ability or hit point damage naturally and can&apos;t prepare spells or regain spell slots. After one night of poor sleep, the target is fatigued (or exhausted if it was fatigued before trying to rest). A creature affected by this spell doesn&apos;t recover from the fatigued or exhausted condition inflicted by this spell after resting, nor do spells such as &lt;i&gt;lesser restoration&lt;/i&gt; provide any respite. Each restless night, the target takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage, which also can&apos;t be recovered by magic while &lt;i&gt;night terrors&lt;/i&gt; is active.  The images from previous nightmares continue to haunt the target&apos;s mind while awake. If the target has rested at least once while affected by &lt;i&gt;night terrors&lt;/i&gt; and then becomes subjected to a fear condition, the target experiences the next higher level of fear than it would normally. However, per the alternate rules for fear (see page 10), this spell cannot cause a lesser state of fear to become a greater one. If the effect causing the fear condition doesn&apos;t usually stack with other fear effects, the target&apos;s level of fear does not increase. This aspect of the spell is a fear effect.  The affected creature can attempt a new saving throw once per day to end &lt;i&gt;night terrors&lt;/i&gt;, but multiple attempts to rest in a given day do not afford the target multiple saves. A creature that  successfully saves against &lt;i&gt;night terrors&lt;/i&gt; ends the spell and rests normally that night but gains the benefits of only that night&apos;s rest, not any benefits missed on previous nights.

This fear of failure manifests as a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls. Additionally, the target can&apos;t gain morale bonuses of any kind while the spell remains in effect. No amount of achievement counters the spell&apos;s effects-the target simply explains away positive events with a self-critical perspective.  Certain events can solidify the character&apos;s belief that it is doomed. Whenever the target rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll or saving throw, fails an ability or skill check by more than 5, or takes additional damage as a result of a foe&apos;s confirmed critical hit, the penalty to roll imposed by &lt;i&gt;pessimism&lt;/i&gt; becomes -3 for 1 round.

If the target fails a second Fortitude save in a row, it falls unconscious for the spell&apos;s remaining duration. The target breathes normally while unconscious, but is shaken for 1 minute upon awakening. If the target succeeds at two Fortitude saves in a row, it shakes off the spell&apos;s effects entirely.

Those who fail to disbelieve &lt;i&gt;phantasmal putrefaction&lt;/i&gt; immediately take 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. This damage occurs only once. Each round at the beginning of its turn, an affected target receives another Will save to disbelieve the effect, and targets that fail must succeed at a Fortitude save or faint, falling a&lt;i&gt;sleep&lt;/i&gt; as per &lt;i&gt;sleep&lt;/i&gt; (except that it isn&apos;t a magical &lt;i&gt;sleep&lt;/i&gt; effect).

Targets of the spell perceive everyone else around them to be rotting away, but other creatures see no visible effect of the spell, so they, in addition to those who disbelieve, can communicate the nature of the illusion to allies, providing those allies with a +4 bonus on the saving throw to disbelieve.

Alternatively, you can name the following specific environments: darkness (darker than dim light, and you can&apos;t apply this &lt;i&gt;phobia&lt;/i&gt; to a creature with natural racial darkvision, see in darkness, blindsight, or similar senses), enclosed spaces (places that require the creature to squeeze),heights (10 times the  target&apos;s height, and you can&apos;t apply this &lt;i&gt;phobia&lt;/i&gt; to creatures with a natural fly speed), or water (you can&apos;t apply this &lt;i&gt;phobia&lt;/i&gt; to aquatic creatures or creatures with a natural swim speed).  When the target takes damage of the energy type (for an energy type &lt;i&gt;phobia&lt;/i&gt;), or perceives the presence of the creature, environment, or hazard, it must attempt a DC 20 Will save. If it fails, it becomes panicked, but even if it succeeds, it becomes shaken and feels intensely uncomfortable; a creature shaken in this way does not need to roll further saving throws against its &lt;i&gt;phobia&lt;/i&gt; until its shaken condition ends, even if it continues to be exposed to its &lt;i&gt;phobia&lt;/i&gt;.

When the sacrifice dies, its blood or ichor pools and hardens into a single red bloodstone. This bloodstone contains the essence and spirit of the sacrificed creature, allowing anyone holding the stone to activate the creature&apos;s highest-level activated racial spell-like ability, taking the actions necessary to activate the stored spell-like ability. Any creature who holds the stone can activate it, but the stone can be used only once per day (or the frequency of the creature&apos;s spell-like ability, whichever is less). If a creature has several racial spell-like abilities of the same spell level, choose randomly from among them to determine which one is stored in the bloodstone. The bloodstone can only store racial spell-like abilities that emulate a spell, including altered spells, like &lt;i&gt;invisibility&lt;/i&gt; (self only), but not unique spell-like abilities possessed by the creature. Abilities with altered effects are still altered, so a creature activating the bloodstone for &lt;i&gt;greater teleport&lt;/i&gt; (self only) would affect only itself and a bloodstone storing &lt;i&gt;summon monster II&lt;/i&gt; (Small fire elemental only) would still only be able to summon a Small fire elemental. Additionally, the bloodstone can&apos;t store spell-like abilities that duplicate spells with expensive components costing more than 250 gp.  The save DC, caster level, and other attributes of this ability remain the same as when the creature was still alive, though the creature who activates the bloodstone can choose the targets, area, or shape of the spell, and make other decisions, such as  controlling the target of &lt;i&gt;dominate person&lt;/i&gt;.

If you relinquish your stewardship of the object (such as giving it away or leaving it in a remote location or extradimensional space), the trapped creature begins to gain control over the object.

These haunts are centered on the object. The creature can also communicate telepathically up to a range of 100 feet at this point.  After 1 month of the object being out of your presence, the CR total of the haunts the trapped creature can create increases to 1/2 its Hit Dice. In addition to telepathy, it can also impart mental images of its choosing into the mind of any creature holding or carrying the object.

If the target is currently suffering from any form of madness (see page 182) or addiction (&lt;i&gt;GameMastery Guide&lt;/i&gt; 236), has total sanity damage greater than or equal to its sanity edge (see page 12), or is under a magical compulsion that could be detected by &lt;i&gt;detect magic&lt;/i&gt;, you can detect the presence of such a disturbance on the first round of concentration.  If you concentrate on the same creature for an additional round, you learn if the creature&apos;s total sanity damage is greater than or equal to its sanity edge, and you can attempt a Sense Motive check against a DC equal to 10 + the save DC of the target&apos;s madness or addiction to determine the exact nature of a madness or addiction. Additionally, you can attempt a Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 11 + the caster level of the compulsion against each magical compulsion currently affecting the target that could be detected by &lt;i&gt;detect magic&lt;/i&gt;.

The spell takes effect immediately if the target is already asleep, or as soon as the target falls asleep if it is conscious. You can specify that the creature should wait before taking action when you give your instructions if you so choose. A sleeping creature doesn&apos;t get a save against this spell. The suggested activity must not cause the target to directly harm itself or others, but it doesn&apos;t need to be reasonable. For example, you could instruct the target to unlock doors and windows or poison its ally&apos;s rations, but not jump off a roof or perform a coup de grace action against a sleeping ally. Instructions that cause direct harm prompt the target to awaken just prior to performing the action and the target experiences a vague memory of what it was supposed to do.  The target moves at its speed, but isn&apos;t capable of running or moving at a higher rate of speed. It moves in dark conditions as if it had darkvision and can perform most simple and skill-based actions, but it can&apos;t engage in combat, spellcasting, or actions that require significant cognitive awareness (like making complex decisions, solving puzzles, or using complicated magic items). If the creature takes any damage while sleepwalking, it must attempt a new saving throw. If it succeeds, the spell ends and the creature awakens. When the target completes the suggested course of activity, or when the spell ends or is dismissed, the target remains unconscious and returns to where it was sleeping and must be awoken normally. It retains no memory of what it did while unconscious (with the only exception described above).  Unlike the sleepwalkAPG spell, attempts to use &lt;i&gt;sleepwalking suggestion&lt;/i&gt; on a creature that is unconscious for any reason other than sleep automatically fail. A creature affected by &lt;i&gt;sleepwalking suggestion&lt;/i&gt; is unaware it has been programmed to act in its sleep (unless awoken because it was about to cause harm).&lt;/p&gt;",Horror Adventures,, Cause a creature to perform a suggested action while asleep.,180

Multiple applications of this spell do not stack, nor does the bonus stack with morale, profane, or sacred bonuses on saving throws against the advancement of the target&apos;s corruption.  The material components for this spell vary with the type of corruption. For example, garlic is used for a vampirism corruption, a sprig of wolfsbane is used for a lycanthropy corruption, and so on.

You attempt a combat maneuver against the target&apos;s CMD. Your CMB for this check is equal to your caster level + 5 due to the straightjacket&apos;s Strength. This combat maneuver doesn&apos;t provoke an attack of opportunity, and if it succeeds, the target is restrained. This is similar to the grappled condition, except the target is able to move at its normal speed, the restraint doesn&apos;t cause the target to require concentration checks to use abilities that require concentration, and the target can&apos;t take actions that require one or more hands or arms to perform (including casting spells that require a somatic or material component).  Once it has been restrained for 1 round, the target can attempt an additional saving throw against a magical effect that makes it confused, a curse, a fear effect, or a madness. The caster chooses which effect the target gets an extra save against. This extra save applies to only effects with durations of 10 minutes per level or less, and it doesn&apos;t apply to instantaneous effects. This extra save occurs only once per casting of &lt;i&gt;straitjacket&lt;/i&gt;.

Creatures that failed their saving throws immediately take 1d6 points of bleed damage and are sickened as long as they continue to take bleed damage from the symbol.  While a DC 15 Heal check or magical healing can end the bleed damage as normal, the bleed damage and sickened condition begin again each round so long as the creature begins its turn still within 60 feet of the symbol, including if the creature leaves the area and returns. Creatures that succeed at their saving throw suffer no ill effects from the symbol, even if they leave its area and return.  Unlike &lt;i&gt;symbol of death&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;symbol of exsanguination&lt;/i&gt; has no hit point limit on the creatures it can affect.

The creatures take 4d6 points of damage and must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d3 points of Constitution damage and 1d3 points of Strength damage; the ability damage is a poison effect. Abilities that protect against swarm attacks apply to this damage and spell resistance applies.  Additionally, since your body is partially a swarm, you take only half damage from piercing and slashing attacks, unless those attacks would deal full damage or greater to a swarm (for instance, an area piercing attack would deal full damage to you). You can still be targeted by single-target spells but you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on any saving throws against them.

Each dog can attempt a Will save to negate the transformation, but if the dog trusts you (it has been trained by you for a purpose, or has been in your care for at least 30 days and generally treated well), it takes a -4 penalty on this saving throw. Each transformed dog has the same stats as a hell hound (&lt;i&gt;Bestiary&lt;/i&gt; 173) except that it doesn&apos;t have fire immunity and cold vulnerability and instead has acid, cold, and fire resistance 5. Additionally, each transformed dog deals an extra 1d6 points of acid damage with its bite attack (instead of fire damage), and its breath weapon is replaced with a vaporous cloud that spreads out in front of the creature in a 10-foot cone, dealing 2d4 points of acid damage. The creature can&apos;t understand Infernal but understands any languages you know. The dog is normally neutral evil, but is chaotic evil if you are chaotic or lawful evil if you are lawful.

The creature must immediately drop all objects held in the withered limb, though it can shift a two-handed weapon it is holding in both hands to a remaining arm as an immediate action. Worn objects-gauntlets, rings, and magic items in the wrist slot-remain. This prevents the creature from using two-weapon fighting, claw attacks from that arm, and so on.

This spell can be cast only on an area of deep water. When a creature enters the area, the haunt manifests, automatically grabbing the creature and dragging it under the water on initiative count 10. Each round, the haunt deals 1d6 points of nonlethal damage as it drags its victim down 10 feet; a successful DC 15 Swim check reduces the descent to 5 feet and negates the nonlethal damage. Each round in the haunt&apos;s clutches reduces the duration the victim can hold her breath by 2 rounds (&lt;i&gt;Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook&lt;/i&gt; 445). A victim can make a single move or standard action each round while in the haunt&apos;s grasp if she succeeds at a Will save; on a failed save, she can only struggle helplessly against the haunt. A victim cannot use her actions to swim toward the surface while the haunt is active. If the haunt reaches the bottom of its body of water, it pounds its victim against the bottom, dealing 2d6 points of nonlethal damage per round to the victim and reducing the  duration the victim can hold her breath by an additional round. This continues until either the haunt is neutralized (in which case the victim must still swim to the surface) or the victim drowns.  The haunt can grab and attempt to drown multiple creatures in its area on its initiative count. The magic holding the haunt together is unstable and deteriorates while the haunt is active.

This spell resistance cannot be voluntarily lowered. Once every 30 minutes as an immediate action, the haunt attempts a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) against an active abjuration effect currently protecting a creature in the affected area against cold, even if it was active before the creature was haunted or it successfully bypassed the spell resistance imposed by the haunt.

When a creature touches the target object, it can attempt a Will save to negate the spell&apos;s effect. Although a successful save prevents the creature from becoming haunted, the haunt still resides within the object, and targets either the next creature to touch the object or the same creature again if it still holds the object after 24 hours. The haunt remains within the object until a creature fails its save or the spell&apos;s duration ends.  Once a creature is affected by the haunt, it begins noticing a large, black mastiff with ominous green eyes watching and following it from a distance, always just beyond the range of focus or interaction. The grim stalker terrorizes the creature&apos;s sleep, affecting it as per &lt;i&gt;nightmare&lt;/i&gt; every night during the spell&apos;s duration (Will negates for one night). Each time the creature takes hit point damage, the grim stalker lunges closer, causing the creature to become shaken for 1 round (Will negates). Each time the creature is reduced to less than one-tenth of its maximum hit points, the grim stalker lunges at the creature as an immediate action, affecting it as per &lt;i&gt;phantasmal killer&lt;/i&gt;.  Each time the grim stalker lunges at the affected creature, the spell&apos;s haunt-like manifestation occurs during that round. Alternatively, a haunted creature can attempt to force the grim  stalker to manifest using a simple ritual that requires a successful Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (religion), or Spellcraft check; occult reagents costing 450 gp (which are consumed as part of the ritual); and a full-round action. The DC for this check equals the spell&apos;s save DC. Successfully performing the ritual causes the grim stalker to manifest as a Nessian warhound (&lt;i&gt;Pathfinder RPG Bestiary&lt;/i&gt; 173) in an available square 20 feet away from the victim, save that its only subtype is extraplanar, its alignment is neutral, its bite and breath weapon deal negative energy damage instead of fire damage, and it has negative energy affinity instead of fire immunity and vulnerability to cold.

At will as an immediate action (but no more often than once every 10 minutes), a &lt;i&gt;mischievous shadow&lt;/i&gt; can interfere with its host&apos;s actions or the actions of adjacent creatures by interacting with their shadows in ways that affect their physical counterparts, such as grabbing the shadow of a crossbow to redirect the physical weapon&apos;s aim.

If you are within range of the spell effect, you can decide how these shadows interfere; otherwise, their actions are timed and decided by the GM as needed, typically manifesting during important or crucial roles. Each time a &lt;i&gt;mischievous shadow&lt;/i&gt; makes such a disruption, the spell&apos;s haunt-like manifestation occurs during that round.&lt;/p&gt;",Haunted Heroes Handbook,,,NULL

This causes such creatures to seek to aid any obvious minions or worshipers of Hastur in sight, and any true worshiper of Hastur can command the affected creatures as if that worshiper had been the one to  &lt;i&gt;dominate&lt;/i&gt; them. In the case of conflicting commands issued from different true worshipers of Hastur, the commanders must attempt opposed Charisma checks, with the winner being able to command the targets for that round.

If it can see multiple items of value in a single room or area, it attempts to steal the item it thinks is worth the most. This covetous compulsion might cause the target to act recklessly where it normally would not (unless acting in this manner would clearly cause it to die, suffer great harm, or get caught).  In combat, if the target sees a valuable item on an opponent, it must, for example, attempt to disarm its foe to take a valuable weapon or use the steal combat maneuver (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&apos;s Guide 322) to grab a precious item kept on the opponent&apos;s belt. Once the target has either attempted to steal an item in combat or else taken damage, this magical compulsion subsides until the threat of the current combat ends and the target enters a new room or area. Affected targets in combat that have neither attempted to steal an item nor taken damage (perhaps because the opponent with the most valuable item is far away) can attempt a saving throw each round to ignore the spell&apos;s effect until the threat ends and the target enters a new room.  &lt;i&gt;Break enchantment&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;limited &lt;i&gt;wish&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;miracle&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;remove curse&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;wish&lt;/i&gt; can each end &lt;i&gt;covetous urge&lt;/i&gt; before the duration expires. &lt;i&gt;Dispel magic&lt;/i&gt; does not affect &lt;i&gt;covetous urge&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;",Villain Codex,,,NULL

Coins increase in value as normal for the new type of coinage. For items other than coins, some of the value of the item comes from its craftsmanship, regardless of the metal used, so the value of the item seems to be 5 times (for silver items) or 50 times (for copper items) its true value.

All but the top 10 feet of the hole is filled with saltwater, reducing the fall damage for anyone falling into the pit to 1d3 points of nonlethal damage and allowing Huge or larger creatures at the water&apos;s surface to simply pull themselves out of the pit as part of a normal move action, without a Climb check. Additionally, the pit contains a single advanced shark (&lt;i&gt;Pathfinder RPG Bestiary&lt;/i&gt; 294, 247) for every 4 caster levels you have (maximum four advanced sharks). If desired, when you cast the spell, you can substitute two of the summoned sharks for one great white shark (&lt;i&gt;Pathfinder RPG Bestiary&lt;/i&gt; 4 241). These sharks immediately attack any creature that falls into the pit, even you. If multiple creatures fall in the pit, the sharks attack randomly. When the spell ends, creatures inside the hole rise up with the bottom of the pit, as normal for &lt;i&gt;create&lt;/i&gt; pit, but the conjured water and sharks vanish.&lt;/p&gt;",Villain Codex,,,NULL

Instead, &lt;i&gt;hoodwink&lt;/i&gt;ed creatures see only the roughest shapes and details and hear only muffled noises. However, targets can clearly hear verbal communication from the spell&apos;s caster. This spell does not impart understanding of the caster&apos;s language if the creature can&apos;t already understand it. Other than to hear the caster speak, targets automatically fail Perception checks with DCs greater than 5, and they are too disoriented by the spell to accurately remember the path they took while under its effects.  While under the effects of this spell, targets without the help of a guide move at half speed, and any attacks they make are treated as though the creature they are attacking had concealment. Moving faster than half speed requires targets to succeed at a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Those that fail this check fall prone. If the target is attacked or physically harmed by any creature other than another target of &lt;i&gt;hoodwink&lt;/i&gt;, the spell&apos;s effect ends immediately for that target only.&lt;/p&gt;",Villain Codex,,,NULL

The figment hangs invisible and obscured upon the target surface for the duration of the spell. Another casting of &lt;i&gt;geomessage&lt;/i&gt; is needed to cause the figment to arrange itself into the intended message.  When you cast the spell, you can choose to incorporate a passphrase into the spell. If you do so, the message is protected as if &lt;i&gt;nondetection&lt;/i&gt; had been cast on it for the full duration of the spell, though creatures that cast &lt;i&gt;geomessage&lt;/i&gt; on the surface and speak the passphrase ignore the &lt;i&gt;nondetection&lt;/i&gt; effect and cause the image to become visible until the caster speaks the passphrase again.  Without a passphrase, the message simply remains invisible to those who cast &lt;i&gt;geomessage&lt;/i&gt;.

While under the effect of this spell, a creature is immune to the effects of brown mold, green slime, russet mold, yellow mold, and any similar hazard, provided the hazard is CR 6 or lower. Similarly, the creature is immune to poison, disease, and infestation attacks from all fungal creatures of CR 6 or lower, including  effects such as basidirond spores, violet fungus rot, and the like. The target is immune to fungus-based toxins, such as striped toadstool. Against similar hazards or monsters of CR 7 or higher, the target gains a bonus on all saving throws against the effect equal to half your caster level. &lt;i&gt;Protection from spores&lt;/i&gt; offers no protection against fungal infestations created by the seeded, by the spell &lt;i&gt;what grows within&lt;/i&gt;, or by Xhamen-Dor.&lt;/p&gt;",AP 113,,,NULL

When you prepare &lt;i&gt;what grows within&lt;/i&gt; for the first time, or the first time you use it via a spell-completion or spell-trigger item, you can thereafter be targeted by Xhamen-Dor&apos;s infected dreams ability (see page 86). As long as you are under the &lt;i&gt;effect&lt;/i&gt;s of &lt;i&gt;what grows within&lt;/i&gt;, your mind-affecting spells carry this supernatural taint within them and can infect those who succumb to those &lt;i&gt;effect&lt;/i&gt;s. Whenever you successfully affect a creature with one of your mind-affecting spells (this requires the target to fail its saving throw against the spell if the spell allows a save, but automatically affects a target if the spell does not allow a saving throw), that target must also succeed at a Fortitude saving throw against &lt;i&gt;what grows within&lt;/i&gt; or it immediately becomes afflicted by a lesser version of Xhamen-Dor&apos;s seeded infestation. This infestation does not expose the victim to Xhamen-Dor&apos;s infectious dreams, but it can ultimately  result in that creature&apos;s transformation into one of the seeded. Each time you affect a creature with &lt;i&gt;what grows within&lt;/i&gt; in this manner, the remaining duration of &lt;i&gt;what grows within&lt;/i&gt; is reduced by 1 round. If you affect multiple creatures in a round, you choose the order in which they must save against the &lt;i&gt;effect&lt;/i&gt;s of &lt;i&gt;what grows within&lt;/i&gt;, and reduce the spell&apos;s remaining duration by 1 round each time one of them is affected by the infestation.

Choose an initial target, which must be alive, and a secondary target, which must be alive or undead. The initial target is dealt a number of points of damage equal to 9d6 + 1 point per caster level. A successful Will saving throw halves the damage dealt. The target might die from damage even if it succeeds on its saving throw.  If the secondary target is a living creature, it regains a number of hit points equal to the amount of damage taken by the initial target. If the secondary target is undead, it instead takes an amount of damage equal to that dealt to the initial target. The secondary target can halve the healing imparted or harm inflicted to it with a successful Will saving throw (although a secondary target receiving healing can forgo this saving throw as normal).  This spell is subject to the spell resistance of the initial target; if the secondary target is unwilling, this spell is also subject to the secondary target&apos;s spell resistance. If the spell does not penetrate the initial target&apos;s spell resistance, it fizzles with no effect. If it does not penetrate the secondary target&apos;s spell resistance, the initial target is still harmed as described, but the secondary target is not healed or harmed.&lt;/p&gt;",Healer&apos;s Handbook,,,NULL

This deals damage to evil creatures and heals good creatures in the area. The amount of damage dealt and the number of hit points restored in each case is 1d8 points per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d8).  Half of the damage this spell deals to evil creatures is fire damage, and half of the damage is pure divine power that is therefore not subject to reduction by energy resistance to fire-based attacks.  Neutral enemies within the spell&apos;s area of effect also take the fire damage, but do not take the divine damage. Neutral allies within the area are healed by half as much as good creatures.

Healing Token,conjuration,healing,,"cleric/oracle 2, druid 2, inquisitor 2, paladin 2, ranger 2, shaman 2",1 standard action,"V, S, DF",touch,,,one touched holy symbol per 3 caster levels,10 minutes/level,Will negates (object),yes (object),"&lt;p&gt;You imbue one touched holy symbol per 3 caster levels with a connection to your own divine power, turning the touched holy symbols into tokens of healing. Each of the targeted holy symbols can represent any deity regardless of the deity&apos;s actual alignment.  As long as you wear or carry your divine focus, any creature carrying a token of healing can make a plea for healing in a language you understand as a standard action. When they do this, you are silently alerted to the plea for healing and can magically heal the target as an immediate action anytime before the end of your next turn.  The magical healing you use to do this can be either a supernatural ability that heals damage (if you have uses available) or a spell or spell-like ability that belongs to the healing subschool (if you can cast any). In either case, to use the ability or cast the spell through this spell, you must be able to include or target that creature, and the ability&apos;s activation time or spell&apos;s casting time must be no longer than one standard action.  If the ability or healing spell you use through a token would affect multiple creatures, such as &lt;i&gt;mass cure light wounds&lt;/i&gt;, the ability or spell affects the creature that pleaded for healing as well as any other creatures within the healing spell&apos;s normal range that are also holding a holy symbol imbued with this spell.  So, for example, when you use &lt;i&gt;mass cure light wounds&lt;/i&gt; through a holy symbol that has been turned into a token of healing, that spell would heal the creature holding the token that pleaded for healing as well as one creature per level that is also holding a token (no two of which can be more than 30 feet apart).

The target creature regains 1d8 hit points per 2 caster levels (maximum 10d8).  This healing can even bring back to life creatures that have been dead within the previous 1 round (but they cannot have been dead for any longer). If you apply this spell&apos;s healing to such a creature and its hit point total is at a negative amount less than its Constitution score, it comes back to life and stabilizes at its new hit point total. If you awaken a dead creature in this way, all allies of that creature within 60 feet who can see it regain consciousness gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws for 1 minute thereafter, as the healing powers of your deity have imbued them with renewed vigor.  Creatures killed by death effects cannot be revived this way.

You restore a number of hit points to the creature equal to 3d8 + 1 per caster level (maximum +20). If the healing would cause the target to exceed its maximum hit points, the target immediately gains half the excess healing from this spell as temporary hit points that last for 1 hour. These temporary hit points are lost first when the target takes damage (although some temporary hit points are lost even before these temporary hit points, such as the temporary hit points from the shell of succor oracle mystery, described on page 21, or the shell of succor hex granted by the restoration spirit specialization and described on page 27).

The surrounding atmosphere and all creatures within the selected area at the end of the spell&apos;s casting time are entombed in this vault.

When creating the vault, you can leave a tunnel to the surface world (up to 20 feet wide), or you can completely isolate the vault from the outside world.

Temporal Divergence,transmutation,,,"psychic 7, sorcerer/wizard 7, witch 7",1 swift action,"V, S, M (mithral wishbone worth 100 gp)",personal,,,you,instantaneous,,,"&lt;p&gt;This spell allows you to witness two divergent decisions and choose which to pursue. Upon completing this spell, you must immediately choose two other different spells that you could cast at that moment and that each have a casting time of 1 standard action; these spells take effect simultaneously, and you must track all resulting effects, areas of effect, saving throws, and other outcomes separately as if each had been cast normally and the other spell had never happened. Once you&apos;ve seen how each spell resolves, you must choose which version of reality occurred, expending the standard action, prepared spell, and material components as necessary. The other spell&apos;s results are ignored and do not require an action or expend the prepared spell, spell slot, or material components. If the targets of the spell you did not choose expended any resources or effects to resist your spell, those resources or effects are also not expended. If you cast this spell and do not or cannot immediately follow the instructions described above, this spell has no effect.  For example, after casting this spell, a wizard could cast &lt;i&gt;temporal stasis&lt;/i&gt; on a demon and &lt;i&gt;fireball&lt;/i&gt; on a group of orcs. Seeing that the demon succeeds at its saving throw against &lt;i&gt;temporal stasis&lt;/i&gt; and that the &lt;i&gt;fireball&lt;/i&gt; kills many orcs, the wizard chooses the &lt;i&gt;fireball&lt;/i&gt; to take effect. The &lt;i&gt;temporal stasis&lt;/i&gt; is treated as if it had not been cast, and its spell slot and costly material component are not expended.  Casting this spell more than once in a single day is risky. On the second and subsequent casting in a 24-hour period, you must succeed at a DC 25 Will saving throw or be exposed to a crippling array of possibilities and paradoxes that leave you confused for 24 hours.

As a standard action while you are within range of the beacon before the spell&apos;s duration expires, you can discharge the spell to transport yourself back to the marked location and restore yourself to the condition you were in when you cast the spell; this does not restore any expended items, charges, or spells you may have used during that time. This does not reverse effects for anyone else, and to bystanders it appears as though you teleported to the beacon location and regained conditions you had when the beacon was set. &lt;i&gt;Temporal regression&lt;/i&gt; strains your body; when the spell is discharged, you gain 1 temporary negative level for every 2 rounds that passed since you cast the spell. These negative levels disappear after 24 hours.

Other objects and creatures within the bubble&apos;s space are also invisible while they stay in the space, which could reveal the spell&apos;s existence to a canny observer who notices fish disappearing into the bubble and reappearing on the other side. Creatures inside the bubble can see each other, which allows foes who can pinpoint the bubble&apos;s location (such as dragons) to stick their heads into the bubble in order to see the target. Any creature on the inside of the bubble that takes any action that would break &lt;i&gt;invisibility&lt;/i&gt; pops the bubble and ends the spell early.

To absorb a rune, you must be aware of the rune&apos;s existence (but need not know the details of what it actually does) and then succeed at a caster level check (DC = 10 + the caster level of the spell affect being absorbed) as you touch the rune in question. If you fail this caster level check, the magical rune is not triggered unless you fail the roll by 5 or more. If you succeed at the caster level check, the rune is removed from the surface it was originally placed upon and duplicated on the cloth of a silk glove worn on your hand. The rune remains located on the glove&apos;s palm in an inert state for up to 1 minute per caster level. As a standard action taken at any time during that duration, you can transfer the rune to another surface similar to the one it was originally placed upon, at which point the rune&apos;s function either returns to normal or dissipates harmlessly as if successfully dispelled (your choice). If the spell&apos;s duration expires before you place the rune on a new surface, the absorbed rune dissipates harmlessly. &lt;i&gt;Absorb rune I&lt;/i&gt; affects only runes whose effects are equivalent to a spell of 3rd level or lower.

While casting this spell, you recite one piece of knowledge (up to a maximum of 50 words). Upon completion of the spell&apos;s casting, you transfer the knowledge from your mind to your skin in the form of an intricate, runic tattoo placed anywhere you choose on your body. The knowledge disappears utterly from your mind, and you might not realize you forgot something. The magic of the spell patches over gaps in your memory with recollections from the past. Until the spell&apos;s duration ends, the knowledge is lost to you. When you cast this spell, you decide how long you wish the spell&apos;s duration to be, up to a maximum duration of 1 day per level. Many Cyphermages commission nonmagical tattoos to disguise the effects of this spell.

While casting &lt;i&gt;rune trace&lt;/i&gt;, you must run your fingers (which cannot be gloved at the time) over the rune, glyph, symbol, or other marking you want to examine (hereafter referred to as the rune). This does not trigger any effects that touching the rune would normally trigger. Runes, symbols, and other effects that trigger when read still trigger as normal if you do so- but note that this spell does not require you to view and read the rune that you&apos;re targeting.

This spell allows you to place a rune upon another creature that can then be used to aid it at a later time. You determine the spell&apos;s effect at the time of casting by using your finger to paint a specific rune on the recipient&apos;s body with a dose of specially prepared paint worth 25 gp. The inscribed rune lasts for 24 hours or until the spell is activated. Unless otherwise noted, the creature upon which the &lt;i&gt;rune of rule&lt;/i&gt; has been inscribed can activate it at any time as a swift action. If the spell effect isn&apos;t used, all markings associated with the rune disappear and the effect fades. You can never place the spell upon yourself-it must be bestowed on someone else. The seven runes of rule, along with their specific effects when the user activates them, are listed below. A creature can bear only one &lt;i&gt;rune of rule&lt;/i&gt; at a time. &lt;b&gt;Charity&lt;/b&gt;: A creature bearing this mark gains a +5 insight bonus on a single attack roll or skill check attempted at the request of another creature, provided the creature bearing this mark does not gain any immediate benefit or reward for making the roll or attempting the check. &lt;b&gt;Generosity&lt;/b&gt;: A creature bearing the rune of generosity can activate it as an immediate action, but it must do so as another creature within 30 feet activates a consumable magic item such as a potion or scroll that was given to it at some point within the last 24 hours by the creature bearing the rune. When the rune is activated, the effects of the consumable magic item resolve at a caster level that is 2 higher than the item&apos;s actual caster level. &lt;b&gt;Humility&lt;/b&gt;: When a creature activates the rune of humility, it does not provoke attacks of opportunity for 1 round. &lt;b&gt;Kindness&lt;/b&gt;: A creature must be using the aid another action or casting a healing spell in order to activate a rune of kindness. If the creature activates the rune while using the aid another action, the bonus imparted on a success increases to +5. If the creature instead activates the rune while casting a healing spell, the effective caster level of the spell increases by 2. &lt;b&gt;Love&lt;/b&gt;: When a creature activates the rune of love as he casts a spell with the charm descriptor, the save DC of that spell increases by 1. Alternatively, a creature can activate the rune of love after he rolls damage for a weapon or spell attack, causing the damage dealt to become nonlethal damage. &lt;b&gt;Temperance&lt;/b&gt;: A creature bearing the rune of temperance can activate it as an immediate action immediately upon failing a saving throw against a poison, disease, drug, or similar effect. The creature can immediately attempt a second saving throw against the effect and can use the result of that second saving throw as the actual result. &lt;b&gt;Zeal&lt;/b&gt;: A creature that activates the rune of zeal gains a +3 bonus on Will saves, and the save DCs of all language-dependent effects created by the creature increase by 1; these effects last for 1 round.&lt;/p&gt;",Adventurer&apos;s Guide,,,25

(The GM adjudicates which rune manifests on the creature&apos;s body, as appropriate.) Each round, at the start of its turn, the target must attempt a new Will saving throw against the spell&apos;s DC to resist the sin&apos;s enslavement. If the target succeeds at this saving throw, it is sickened for that round by the distractions of its sin. If it fails, it is sickened and staggered as it spends part of its action wallowing in its targeted sin (a wrathful victim might waste time spouting threats and profanity, while a slothful victim might merely be slow and hesitant, and a lustful victim could well spend precious moments ogling or fawning over something of beauty).&lt;/p&gt;",Adventurer&apos;s Guide,,,NULL

If instead you suppress charms and compulsions, the spell&apos;s duration drops to concentration, to a maximum duration of 1 round per level. As long as you continue to concentrate, the spell suppresses all existing charm and compulsion effects affecting the targets, regardless of whether the effect is beneficial or harmful.

The mark can be placed on any exposed portion of the creature, typically the head or forearm. While branded in this way, the recipient loses the ability to speak or understand its racial language and the language of its homeland or primary culture (if these are different). For example, an elf raised among the Shoanti would lose Elven and Shoanti (if she knew both those languages), while a halfling raised among dwarves would lose both Halfling and Dwarven (if she knew both those languages). A gnome raised among gnomes would lose Gnome, but no other language. This spell never suppresses Common or Undercommon, nor does it prevent spellcasting, though it may prevent a target from speaking intelligibly if it suppresses all of the target&apos;s languages.

While the target is branded in this way, twice per day as a standard action, you can instantly determine in what direction and how far away the target is, as long as it is within a range equal to 1 mile per your caster level. If the target travels beyond this range or to another plane, you cannot gain information about the recipient&apos;s location. Similarly, if the target becomes warded by a spell or effect that thwarts divination spells (such as nondetection) or moves into such an area (such as one created by &lt;i&gt;antimagic&lt;/i&gt; field), you cannot gain information about the target&apos;s location. This effect otherwise works as a &lt;i&gt;locate creature&lt;/i&gt; spell that lasts for 1 minute per caster level. It can be fooled by &lt;i&gt;mislead&lt;/i&gt; but not by &lt;i&gt;polymorph&lt;/i&gt;. A brand of tracking can be hidden by clothing or temporarily removed by scraping it away (the latter deals 1d6 points of damage, though the brand returns if that damage is healed, or 1 day later otherwise). The effects of a brand of tracking continue to function even when hidden or scraped away. A brand of tracking cannot be dispelled, but it can be permanently removed by any means that removes a mark of justice (see page 312 of the &lt;i&gt;Pathfinder RPG Core&lt;/i&gt; Rulebook).&lt;/p&gt;",Adventurer&apos;s Guide,,,NULL

The area within a 50-foot radius of where the devil appears is ringed with a smoldering, red glow. This area is the testing ground. To successfully cast this spell, no creature other than the devil&apos;s challenger (see below) can be within this area while the spell is being cast. On the round it appears, the devil identifies itself (typically by name and with a brief recitation of honors) and states it is prepared to do battle with a sole mortal champion. In the same round, either you or a creature you designate while casting the spell must identify the devil&apos;s challenger. For the duration of the spell, the devil does everything in its power to kill the challenger. You do not control the devil or have any influence over how it conducts itself in battle, but the devil cannot leave the testing ground. Unlike with &lt;i&gt;summon monster&lt;/i&gt; and similar spells, you cannot dismiss the devil. Rather, the conjured devil remains until any one of the following criteria is met: it is reduced below 0 hit points or otherwise defeated, its challenger is slain, its challenger leaves the testing ground, or it takes damage from any source other than its challenger. Upon any of these occurrences, the devil vanishes. Conjuring a devil is typically an evil act. If cast for any purpose besides the administering of a Hellknight test, this spell has the evil descriptor.&lt;/p&gt;",Adventurer&apos;s Guide,,,NULL

When you cast this spell, you can choose whether the restraints are manacles or fetters (manacles specifically designed to fit around the ankles). You also summon the restraints&apos; key to your person; the Disable Device DC to open the locked restraints is equal to 15 + your caster level + the modifier of your primary casting ability score. Typically, the restraints appear in your hands. However, as part of the spell&apos;s casting, you can make a melee touch attack against a creature; if you succeed and the creature then fails a Reflex saving throw against the spell&apos;s DC, the locked fetters appear clasped on the creature or locked manacles clasp you and the creature together. You can instead have manacles restrain the target&apos;s limbs in front of or behind it. If you cast the spell as a full-round action, you can make melee touch attacks against two creatures you can reach. If you succeed at both attacks and both creatures fail their Reflex saving throws, you can cause the set of manacles to bind the targets together. As you increase in level, the restraints become stronger and you gain more control over them. If you are 6th level or higher, you can make the restraints mithral, or you can summon Tiny or Large restraints. If you are 12th level or higher, you can summon Diminutive or Huge restraints. If you use an emerald worth at least 1,000 gp as a material component while casting this spell, as a standard action once during its duration, you can affect any creature bound by these restraints as per &lt;i&gt;dimensional anchor&lt;/i&gt; with a duration of 1 minute per caster level. If you are 18th level or higher and use an emerald worth at least 1,000 gp as a material component while casting this spell, the restraints&apos; hardness increases to 30, they have 60 hit points, and they can&apos;t be broken with a successful Strength check. (The emerald must be worth at least 2,000 gp if you also wish to use the &lt;i&gt;dimensional anchor&lt;/i&gt; effect described earlier.) If you cast this spell before the duration of a previous casting has lapsed, you can create a new set of restraints or reset the previous spell&apos;s duration. If you used an expensive material component during a previous casting, you must again use a component when creating new restraints or resetting the duration if you wish to maintain the special effect. You do not need to touch these previously created shackles to renew their duration, though you must be on the same plane as the shackles. When this spell ends, the restraints disappear, and any ongoing effects created by the spell end.&lt;/p&gt;",Adventurer&apos;s Guide,,,NULL

While in effect, this spell functions like &lt;i&gt;nondetection&lt;/i&gt;, except it also foils divination spells that attempt to gather information about the creature, even if they don&apos;t target it specifically. In the case of divination spells that would normally reveal the wearer&apos;s presence, such as &lt;i&gt;see invisibility&lt;/i&gt;, the spell works, but the wearer is detected only if the caster succeeds at a caster level check. Likewise, scrying attempts that specifically target the wearer do not work at all unless the caster succeeds at a caster level check. In addition, the DCs of skill checks to learn about the wearer or identify the wearer and its strengths and weaknesses- including Diplomacy checks to gather information, Perception checks opposed by the target&apos;s Disguise checks, and Knowledge checks-increase by 4.

This spell calls a creature from another plane to your precise location, functioning like &lt;i&gt;lesser planar ally&lt;/i&gt; except as noted. When you call a creature using &lt;i&gt;planar inquiry&lt;/i&gt;, the only task that you can ask of the creature is for it to answer questions or gather information regarding a specific topic (a person, a place, or a thing). After hearing your request, if the creature has an appropriate Knowledge skill, it can attempt a check to provide the information it has. If it lacks such a skill, the called creature leaves for 1d4 hours to gather this information. Upon its return, you roll 1d20 + your caster level, and use the result to determine what information the creature has gathered about the subject (as if using Diplomacy). The called creature stays for up to 10 minutes as it relays this information to you, after which it departs to its home plane. If the creature is attacked or damaged at any time during the spell&apos;s duration, the spell ends and the creature returns to the plane from which you summoned it. When you cast this spell, you can choose a specific kind of outsider to call, even calling an individual creature by name. The kind of outsider called doesn&apos;t alter the effects of the spell, but when you use &lt;i&gt;planar inquiry&lt;/i&gt; to summon a creature with an alignment or elemental subtype, the spell gains that descriptor. You cannot call an outsider whose Hit Dice exceed your caster level (maximum 18 HD) and you cannot use this spell to contact a unique outsider (such as a deity&apos;s herald) or an outsider with mythic ranks.&lt;/p&gt;",Adventurer&apos;s Guide,,,100

Invoke Primal Power,transmutation,,,druid 5,1 swift action,"V, S",personal,,,you,1 round/level,none,no,"&lt;p&gt;This spell must be cast as you activate wild shape to assume the form of an animal of at least Large size. When you assume the animal form, it takes on many of the primal characteristics of the savage, prehistoric creatures that dwell in the Realm of the Mammoth Lords. When this spell&apos;s duration expires, you return to your natural form automatically-in effect, you shorten the duration of that use of wild shape to the duration of this spell when you cast &lt;i&gt;invoke primal power&lt;/i&gt;. In addition to the normal effects you gain upon assuming the wild shape, you also gain a +4 size bonus to your Constitution score and increase the natural armor bonus granted by the effect by 2 (thus, if you assume the size of a Large animal as if via &lt;i&gt;beast shape II&lt;/i&gt;, your natural armor bonus is +6 instead of +4). Furthermore, you gain one of the following additional abilities while you are in your enhanced wild shape form. At caster level 13th, you gain two of the following abilities, and at caster level 17th, you gain three of the abilities.  &lt;b&gt;Cold Resistance&lt;/b&gt;: Your new body is covered with thick layers of fur and insulating blubber. You gain cold resistance 30.  &lt;b&gt;Ferocity&lt;/b&gt;: You remain conscious and can continue to fight even if your hit point total is below 0. You are still staggered and lose 1 hit point each round, and still die when your hit point total reaches a negative amount equal to your Constitution score.  &lt;b&gt;Giant Slayer&lt;/b&gt;: Your new form is particularly suited for slaying giants.

When you make a charge attack, this natural attack deals 2d6 additional points of damage in addition to the normal benefits and hazards of a charge. This damage applies only to the first attack you make when you perform your charge.  &lt;b&gt;Rend&lt;/b&gt;: Once per round, if you hit the same target with two or more natural attacks in a round, you rend the target of those attacks, dealing 2d6 additional points of damage.  &lt;b&gt;Swift&lt;/b&gt;: Your new form&apos;s base speed increases by 20 feet.  &lt;b&gt;Trample&lt;/b&gt;: As a full-round action, you can attempt to overrun any creature that is at least one size category smaller than you.

If a targets forgoes an attack of opportunity, it can attempt a Reflex save to avoid the trample and take half damage. The save DC against this effect is equal to 10 + half your caster level + your Strength modifier. You can deal only trampling damage to each target once per round, no matter how many times your movement takes you over a target creature.  &lt;b&gt;Trip&lt;/b&gt;: Choose one of the natural attacks granted to you by your new form.

Back doors informs you of hidden passages and other means of navigation within your target&apos;s home.

You can attempt Survival checks to follow tracks as part of concentrating on the spell, but only events connected to the tracks used as the focus of the spell are revealed by the spell.

Only one type of construction can be created with each casting of the spell, and the creation remains stationary unless destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each 5-foot section of the object created by this spell has a break DC of 23, AC 11, and 1 hit point per caster level (maximum 10 hp), but all sections of the creation are magically supported and need not be anchored to a solid surface or any other portion of the effect. Destroying one part of it does not cause the remainder of the structure to collapse, though each 5-foot section destroyed reduces the maximum weight the creation can support by 200 pounds. During any round in which the rope is overloaded, every remaining section takes 1d4 points of damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use &lt;i&gt;ropeweave&lt;/i&gt; to create any of the following structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rope Bridge&lt;/b&gt;: The rope forms a 5-foot-wide bridge that spans up to 10 feet horizontally per caster level you have (maximum 100 feet). Creatures can cross the bridge at half speed with a successful DC 5 Acrobatics check or at full speed with a successful DC 10 Acrobatics check. The DC assumes a creature is using both hands to assist in navigating the rope bridge; the DC increases by 5 if a creature uses only one hand to steady itself and by 10 if the creature does not use its hands. A failed Acrobatics check results in failure to progress across the rope bridge; creatures that fail by 5 or more fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rope Hammock&lt;/b&gt;: The rope knits itself into a stationary hammock suspended in midair. The hammock can be suspended at a height of 5 feet plus 5 feet per 2 caster levels you have (maximum 30 feet), with a rope ladder (see below) leading up to a platform of 1 5-foot square per caster level, and at least one such square must be adjacent to the square containing the vertical rope ladder. As a move action, the caster can command the rope ladder to withdraw into the hammock. When the ladder is withdrawn, the rope hammock blends in with its surroundings and muffles sounds and smells from creatures resting on it that are taking no violent actions; noticing the rope hammock requires a successful DC 20 Perception check or Survival check, even for creatures with scent. This does not apply if the creatures in the hammock attack or move more than half speed. The hammock provides a +2 cover bonus to AC against attacks from beneath it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rope Ladder&lt;/b&gt;: The rope knots itself and hangs suspended in midair, perpendicular to the ground, stretching up to 10 feet vertically per caster level you have (maximum 100 feet). Climbing the rope ladder requires a successful DC 5 Climb check, or DC 0 if there is a wall adjacent to it you can brace it against.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trip Line&lt;/b&gt;: The rope stretches into a tangled mass that fills one 5-foot square per caster level you have (maximum 10 squares), all of which must be contiguous (including diagonally). Any creature entering a square with this trip line must succeed at an Acrobatics check (DC = 10 if moving at half speed, DC = 15 if moving at full speed, and DC = 20 if running or charging). On a failed check, the creature&apos;s movement stops when it enters the square; a creature that fails by 5 or more falls prone.

Exposed water that enters the area ebbs away, evaporating or leaching into the ground at a rate of 1 foot of depth per hour. Living creatures in the area when the spell is cast are parched with thirst and take a -4 penalty on Constitution checks to resist the effects of a hot climate, and their daily water requirement to avoid thirst doubles (&lt;i&gt;Pathfinder RPG &lt;i&gt;Core Rulebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; 444). Plant creatures and inanimate plants take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per hour after the first 24 hours, which bypasses hardness and damage reduction. Living creatures with the aquatic or water subtype, unless completely immersed in water, must attempt a DC 20 Constitution check each hour no matter how much water they drink. A creature that fails takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and becomes fatigued until it recovers from the nonlethal damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 1 week, the soil in the area of &lt;i&gt;sea of dust&lt;/i&gt; begins to break down and blow away. Moderate winds have a 50% chance each hour to cause sandstorms (&lt;i&gt;Core Rulebook&lt;/i&gt; 431). This chance increases to 75% in strong winds and 100% in severe or stronger winds. Short-duration wind effects such as &lt;i&gt;gust of wind&lt;/i&gt; create sandstorms with the same area and duration as the spell, plus an identical duration after the spell ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 1 month, the soil in an area affected by &lt;i&gt;sea of dust&lt;/i&gt; has virtually disintegrated. The area is treated as a shallow bog for the purposes of movement (&lt;i&gt;Core Rulebook&lt;/i&gt; 427), with a 25% chance each hour to encounter an area equivalent to a deep bog 2d6x10 feet across, and a 5% chance to encounter a collapsing dust drift equivalent to quicksand (&lt;i&gt;Core Rulebook&lt;/i&gt; 427) 1d6x5 feet across. The affected region remains desertlike in condition until the magic is dispelled, at which point the region recovers and returns to its original terrain over the course of time (this may take only days or weeks, or it could take months or even years, subject to GM discretion). This spell has no effect if cast on an entirely aquatic region.

If there is a ceiling or other barrier overhead, the maximum height of the tree cannot exceed the space available. At any point along the tree&apos;s height, you can create a sturdy wooden building that fills one 10-foot cube for every 4 caster levels you have. All portions of the structure must be adjacent to the trunk of the tree (or can have the tree trunk extend up through their spaces), but otherwise these cubes need not be contiguous. If you place the cubes so that they are contiguous, the buildings merge together, complete with ladders connecting different vertical levels. The fort is magically supported, but if the tree it is attached to is destroyed, the structure is destroyed as well (the tree has hardness 5 and 20 hp per caster level you have).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each building you create has shuttered arrow slits on its walls and in the floor, granting those within the structure improved cover against attacks from outside while the arrow slits are open and total cover when they are closed.

(At the GM&apos;s discretion, other drugs of similar power can be included on this list.) The drug doses the caster creates with this spell must be used within 1 minute of being conjured, or they dissolve into worthless dust or evaporate into noxious but fleeting vapors, though the effects of the drug may last far longer if taken before it decays.  The drugs created by this spell cannot be sold, but they can be given to other creatures. A creature that takes a dose of one of these drug typically must be either willing or helpless, though some drugs might be inhaled, applied to injuries, or secretly slipped into food if the caster acts swiftly (see each drug&apos;s description). The DC to resist a drug created by this spell is based on the conjurer&apos;s caster level, not the DC listed in the common versions of the drug. For more information, see Drugs and Addiction on page 236 of the &lt;i&gt;Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide&lt;/i&gt;.  As a special use of this spell, a lawful evil worshiper of Mahathallah, the Dowager of Illusions, can create doses of the drug adyton (see the sidebar above).

If the creature is alive and fails its saving throw, it dies and you capture its soul in the gem. If the creature is dead, it can still resist the spell effect by attempting a Will save as if it were still alive. The value of the soul gem created depends on the nature of the creature it is made from (see page 191). Soul gems created by this spell crumble to dust once the spell&apos;s duration expires, releasing the trapped soul to travel on to judgment in the Great Beyond.  Only one soul gem can be created from a dying creature. Any attempt to resurrect a body whose soul is trapped in a soul gem requires a caster check against &lt;i&gt;create soul&lt;/i&gt; gem&apos;s save DC. Failure results in the resurrection spell having no effect, while success shatters the target&apos;s soul gem and returns the creature to life as normal. If the soul gem resides in an unholy location, such as that created by the &lt;i&gt;unhallow&lt;/i&gt; spell, the DC of this check increases by 2.  If you are a souldrinker (see page 212), you can cast this spell and expend 5 soul points to fill the gem with the equivalent of one basic soul.&lt;/p&gt;",Book of the Damned,,,500

You can fire one ray, plus one additional ray for every 4 caster levels beyond 11th (to a maximum of three rays at 19th level). Each ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). Half the damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from unholy power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by fire resistance. The rays can be fired at the same target or at different targets, but all rays must be fired simultaneously and aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other.  Any creature killed by this spell must attempt a Will saving throw; failure means the creature&apos;s soul is damned to Hell as a burst of brimstone appears around its corpse. A nonevil spellcaster attempting to bring the creature back from the dead  must attempt a caster level check (DC = 10 + the slain creature&apos;s level) to succeed; failure means the spellcaster cannot try again for 1 day.

You gain one claw attack, which is a primary natural attack that deals 1d6 points of slashing damage on a hit (1d4 for a Small spellcaster) and forces the creature struck to succeed at a Fortitude save against the spell (spell resistance applies) to resist gaining 1 negative level. Each time you inflict a negative level with this spell, you gain 5 temporary hit points that persist for 1 hour. A creature that succeeds at the saving throw against your claw&apos;s negative level is immune to further negative levels inflicted from this casting of &lt;i&gt;lash of the astradaemon&lt;/i&gt; but not to the claw&apos;s damage. The claw does not interfere with your ability to cast spells or perform other actions that require hands. You can use your claw attack up to 1 time per 2 caster levels.

If you are lawful evil, souls are sent to Hell. If you are neutral evil, souls are sent to Abaddon. If you are chaotic evil, souls are sent to the Abyss.  A target killed while under the effect of this spell cannot be resurrected by normal means. Only a worshiper of a deity or demigod of your alignment can return a soul damned by &lt;i&gt;malediction&lt;/i&gt; to life without difficulty. Other spellcasters must succeed at a caster level check (DC = 10 + your caster level) to restore to life a creature slain while under the effects of  &lt;i&gt;malediction&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Miracle&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;wish&lt;/i&gt; can return the victim of a &lt;i&gt;malediction&lt;/i&gt; to life without requiring a caster level check.  A soul can also be freed by the efforts of someone bodily going to the appropriate plane, locating the affected soul, and leading it out of the plane, which allows it to go to its intended destination in the afterlife and be resurrected as normal. You can end the effects of your own &lt;i&gt;malediction&lt;/i&gt; by casting the spell again and concentrating on a past target. Doing so only frees the past target to go to its rightful place in death; it does not return the target to life.  Spells such as &lt;i&gt;break enchantment&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;dispel magic&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;remove curse&lt;/i&gt; negate this spell if successfully cast before the target dies.&lt;/p&gt;",Book of the Damned,,,NULL

You must create the rift on a horizontal surface of sufficient size. Since the rift extends into the Abyss, it does not displace the original underlying material or allow access to areas below the surface-you can create the rift on the deck of a ship as easily as in a dungeon floor or the ground of a forest. Any Large or smaller creature standing in the area where you conjure the rift must succeed at a Reflex save to avoid falling into the hole. If successful, the creature picks which side of the rift it remains on once the rift opens. Unattended objects and structures that can be fully engulfed by the rift automatically fall into it.  The walls of the rift are covered with razor-sharp blades, while the floor seethes with boiling pools of acid, strange chewing  vermin, writhing shards of ice, and all manner of other chaotic and deadly manifestations of the Abyss. A creature that falls into the rift takes 6d6 points of falling damage. Any creature in the rift (starting on the round it enters) takes an additional 6d6 points of damage from the rift&apos;s environs, even if the creature is merely climbing or flying within the rift rather than standing at the bottom. This additional damage changes from round to round and is randomly selected from acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic. Each round, a creature in the rift can attempt a Reflex save to take half damage that round. The rift&apos;s walls have a Climb DC of 25.  When this spell&apos;s duration ends, the rift snaps shut, violently expelling all creatures still within. These creatures take double damage from the rift&apos;s environs in that round and are knocked prone as they are returned to the surface above.  At any time during the spell&apos;s duration, you can use it to conjure a number of Abyssal denizens into the surrounding region as a standard action. Doing so causes the rift to snap shut, ending the spell&apos;s duration and returning any creatures that had fallen into it to the ground as detailed above. As the rift snaps shut, choose one of the following creatures or groups of creatures to appear in the area; these Abyssal denizens are treated as if you had summoned them via &lt;i&gt;summon monster VII&lt;/i&gt; and remain for a number of rounds equal to the remaining duration of the &lt;i&gt;rift of ruin&lt;/i&gt; spell.

A sacrifice can be used in a variety of ways.  &lt;b&gt;Bargain&lt;/b&gt;: Making a sacrifice directly to the conjured being grants you a bonus on opposed Charisma checks made to compel the creature into service for the next hour.  &lt;b&gt;Enticement&lt;/b&gt;: Making a sacrifice the round before conjuring increases the DC of the Will save an outsider must attempt to resist being conjured.  &lt;b&gt;Payment&lt;/b&gt;: Making a sacrifice directly to the conjured being allows you to pay for one service from the creature in commodities other than gold.  &lt;b&gt;Reinforcement&lt;/b&gt;: Making a sacrifice the round before creating a magic circle and preparing a summoning diagram amplifies the power of its warding magic, increasing the DC of Charisma checks the creature might attempt to escape. This lasts 1 day.  Multiple sacrifices can be made to affect a single conjuring, but the bonuses provided by this spell do not stack. Therefore, while you can make sacrifices to aid in conjuring and bargaining with a creature, you cannot make multiple sacrifices (even of varying types) to enhance the same effect for a particular conjuration.  A sacrifice can consist of any kind of commodity the target creature favors, including living creatures, treasures, or more ephemeral offerings. While this spell is not fundamentally evil, good-aligned creatures are more selective in what offerings they accept, typically scoffing at blood sacrifices. Many sacrifices are fundamentally evil acts, such as murdering a pious innocent to conjure a fiend. Any creature might reject certain types of sacrifices, thus denying you the benefits of this spell, as the offering must appeal to the target-few outsiders would care for 2,000 gp worth of parchment, while 2,000 gp of diamonds would be widely coveted. The GM determines what sacrifices creatures find appealing.  The table below lists a number of likely offerings, along with the bonus such gifts provide and the offering&apos;s equivalent value in gold pieces for the purposes of &lt;i&gt;planar ally&lt;/i&gt;. Several of these sacrifices involve the loss of ability scores, levels, or lives, and some can cause changes in alignment. Any change wrought by such sacrifices (loss of ability score or level, or change in alignment) cannot be recovered, cured, or undone by any spell or effect short of &lt;i&gt;miracle&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;wish&lt;/i&gt;. The same is true of creatures killed as a sacrifice; such creatures cannot be resurrected by any magic less powerful than these spells. Any object sacrificed with this spell is effectively destroyed or removed to an extraplanar holding of the conjured creature&apos;s choice. The bonuses and values noted on the sacrifice effects table are guidelines for offerings; certain types of treasures or lives might prove especially valuable to specific creatures, with extraordinary sacrifices (such as a potent artifact or the life of a high-level paladin) garnering increased bonuses.  You cannot make greater sacrifices than those noted on the table to gain increased bonuses or gold values. For example, you could not gain 2 permanent negative levels to gain a +16 bonus, nor gain increased benefit from slaying 20 Hit Dice worth of creatures to pay for a 10-HD creature&apos;s service.  &lt;b&gt;Granted&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Type Sacrifice Bonus GP Value&lt;/b&gt;  Treasures 100 gp/HD of target +1 Equal  Lives1 One living creature +2 200 gp/HD with HD equal to target  Body/Mind1 Reduction of ability score +4 500 gp/point by 1 reduced  Morals2 Alignment shifts one step +6 1,000 gp/step toward target&apos;s  Soul1 One permanent negative +8 2,500 gp level  1 When used to sacrifice a life, body, mind, or soul other than the caster&apos;s own, this is an evil act.  2 A character can sacrifice only her own morals, and can do so only once per lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;",Book of the Damned,,,NULL

It does not work on creatures formed from souls or planar material (such as most outsiders). &lt;i&gt;Soul transfer&lt;/i&gt; is mainly used to transfer souls from one receptacle to another, but it can also be used to capture vulnerable souls that aren&apos;t bound to mortal flesh (such as incorporeal creatures and petitioners).

The liquid functions in all the same ways as unholy water (see &lt;i&gt;curse&lt;/i&gt; water). In addition, any creature that is anointed with or drinks this fluid must attempt a Fortitude save (drinking the &lt;i&gt;waters of Lamashtu&lt;/i&gt; is particularly effective-a creature that drinks the liquid takes a -4 penalty on its save to resist its effects). Success causes the creature to become violently ill, vomit up the fluid, and become sickened for 1d4 rounds. Failure indicates the water takes root and wreaks havoc on the victim&apos;s mind (dealing 1d6 points of Intelligence damage) and twists and deforms its body (dealing 1d6 points of Dexterity damage). The subject&apos;s Dexterity and Intelligence cannot drop below 1 as a result of this effect. Casting this spell creates approximately 2 ounces of the &lt;i&gt;waters of Lamashtu&lt;/i&gt;-enough for one dose or, if bottled, one use as a thrown weapon.  The fluid can be created and stored indefinitely, though it cannot be created inside a creature. Extensive exposure to the &lt;i&gt;waters of Lamashtu&lt;/i&gt; (such as drinking nothing else for months at a time) can have other long-term effects on the target, including the development of monstrous deformities or even total transformation into a beast, depending on the GM&apos;s discretion (these mutations are rarely, if ever, beneficial to the victim).&lt;/p&gt;",Book of the Damned,,,250

Second, a warded creature gains spell resistance 23 against spells cast by chaotic neutral, lawful neutral, neutral evil, and neutral good creatures, and spell resistance 27 against spells cast by neutral creatures with no other alignment components.  Third, the spell protects warded creatures from possession and influence by such creatures (otherwise as &lt;i&gt;protection from&lt;/i&gt; evil).

Second, upon making a successful melee touch attack against a creature from another plane with a neutral component to its alignment, you can banish that creature back to its home plane.

If the creature&apos;s alignment is neutral with no other alignment components, the creature takes a -2 penalty on this saving throw. This use discharges and ends the spell.  Third, with a touch, you can automatically dispel any one enchantment spell cast by a creature with a neutral component to its alignment.

When you cast this spell, choose a domain offered by your deity. You gain that domain&apos;s benefits from the list below, along with the listed physical changes; abilities that allow a saving throw use this spell&apos;s DC. At any point during the duration of this spell, you can change which domain benefit you gain by concentrating for 1 round-this provokes attacks of opportunity and reduces the remaining duration of the spell by 10 minutes. If you have less than 10 minutes of the spell&apos;s duration remaining, you cannot change the selected domain in this way. If you change your domain, all ongoing effects from your previously chosen domain end.  You must worship a single divinity in order to cast this spell, even if you do not normally cast divine spells.

You can use &lt;i&gt;speak with animals&lt;/i&gt; at will.  &lt;b&gt;Artifice&lt;/b&gt;: Parts of your body are replaced by pistons and gears.

You are immune to additional damage from critical hits and precision damage (such as sneak attack damage), and weapons you wield count as chaotic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.  &lt;b&gt;Charm&lt;/b&gt;: You become overwhelmingly attractive and persuasive.

You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Dexterity.  &lt;b&gt;Luck&lt;/b&gt;: The faint sound of tinkling bells plays around you. You gain a +1 luck bonus to your Armor Class and on attack rolls, ability checks, saving throws, and skill checks. As an immediate action, you can force a single creature within 10 feet to reroll a single d20 it just rolled-you must use this ability before the results of the d20 roll are known. Each time you use this ability, the remaining duration of &lt;i&gt;invoke deity&lt;/i&gt; decreases by 10 minutes, and you can&apos;t use this ability if you have less than 10 minutes remaining of the spell&apos;s duration.  &lt;b&gt;Madness&lt;/b&gt;: Your voice takes on an eerie, grating quality.

You cannot target a creature more than once a minute with this effect.  &lt;b&gt;Magic&lt;/b&gt;: You shimmer with magical power.

You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Wisdom.  &lt;b&gt;Rune&lt;/b&gt;: Your skin is marked with runic tattoos. Your presence does not trigger the effects of &lt;i&gt;glyphs of warding&lt;/i&gt;, symbol spells, and similar effects unless you choose to, and you are immune to their harmful effects. You can use &lt;i&gt;read magic&lt;/i&gt; at will and can resolve the effects of scrolls using your own caster level rather than the scroll&apos;s caster level.  ScalykindB6: Your flesh becomes squamous, and your mouth grows venomous fangs. You gain a bite attack that deals damage as normal for a creature of your size; if you already have a bite attack, the damage increases as if you had increased one size category. Each creature you bite must succeed at a Fortitude save or become sickened for 1d4 rounds (or if already sickened, staggered for 1 round); this is a poison effect.  &lt;b&gt;Strength&lt;/b&gt;: Your body visibly ripples with muscle. You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to &lt;b&gt;Strength&lt;/b&gt;.  &lt;b&gt;Sun&lt;/b&gt;: Your form blazes with solar light.

Judgment Undone,necromancy,,,"cleric/oracle 9, psychic 9, shaman 9",10 minutes,"V, S, M (diamonds worth 50,000 gp), F (see text)",touch,,,one willing petitioner,instantaneous,none,no,"&lt;p&gt;This powerful, elaborate, and risky spell undoes Pharasma&apos;s judgment, returning a willing petitioner to its mortal life. This spell must be cast on the plane to which the petitioner was sent, and the petitioner must be present for the entire casting. In addition, the caster must provide a specific object that the petitioner valued deeply in its mortal life as a focus for the spell. This is different for every petitioner and usually requires research to discover, although those who knew the petitioner well in life can often identify the item easily. At the completion of the spell&apos;s casting, the petitioner returns to the mortal form it had as a young adult, with all of its memories and class levels (or equivalent statistics) intact.  The casting of &lt;i&gt;judgment undone&lt;/i&gt; is not without risk. The servants of Pharasma vigilantly watch for perversions of the order of fate and death, though it can take time for them to pinpoint disruptions when they occur. After 1d6+5 minutes from the beginning of this spell&apos;s 10-minute casting time, an olethrosB6 appears within 50 feet of the caster; this psychopomp demands the caster cease casting the spell immediately and attacks if its request is ignored. The psychopomp never attempts to harm the petitioner unless &lt;i&gt;judgment undone&lt;/i&gt; has already been successfully cast by the time the psychopomp arrives, in which case it attempts to eliminate the returned mortal as well. If the caster and returned mortal are no longer present, the olethros does what she can to track both down and exact judgment-how successful she may be depends on the GM&apos;s discretion.  The caster of &lt;i&gt;judgment undone&lt;/i&gt; can pause the spell&apos;s casting for up to 1 minute without causing the spell to fail. During this time, the caster does not need to concentrate on &lt;i&gt;judgment undone&lt;/i&gt; and can act normally and cast other spells without disrupting the spell, but if she does not begin casting again before this 1-minute window elapses, the spell fails.  It is possible to cast &lt;i&gt;judgment undone&lt;/i&gt; without incurring the wrath of a psychopomp, but doing so requires the caster to first visit the Boneyard and seek out a powerful agent of Pharasma to gain permission to restore the petitioner to its mortal life. The details and difficulty of this task are subject to the GM&apos;s discretion, but at the very least should involve a significant expenditure of time and resources. The granting of permission to cast &lt;i&gt;judgment undone&lt;/i&gt; is an excellent reward for a quest given to a party of adventurers from a powerful psychopomp. If the PCs exceed expectations in fulfilling this quest, it&apos;s not unheard of for the psychopomp to not only grant permission for the spell&apos;s casting, but to also provide the diamonds needed for the spell&apos;s material component, information about the required focus, or even both. Worshipers of Pharasma who cast this spell without securing permission in this manner are considered to have grossly violated Pharasma&apos;s code of conduct.&lt;/p&gt;",Planar Adventures,,Restores a petitioner to its mortal life.,50000

When this spell is cast, you can replicate a number of effects from one or more of the following spells: &lt;i&gt;control water&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;diminish plants&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;fog cloud&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;major creation&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;move earth&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;plant growth&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;secure shelter&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;soften earth and stone&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;spike growth&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;spike stones&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;stone shape&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;transmute mud to rock&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;transmute rock to mud&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;wall of stone&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;wall of thorns&lt;/i&gt;. The total spell levels of effects to be &lt;i&gt;create&lt;/i&gt;d must not exceed 8. For example, you could use this spell to replicate the effects of &lt;i&gt;fog cloud&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;secure shelter&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;soften earth and stone&lt;/i&gt; (since these three spells have levels that add up to 8) or &lt;i&gt;diminish plants&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;spike stones&lt;/i&gt; (since these two spells have levels that add up to 7), but not &lt;i&gt;move earth&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;plant growth&lt;/i&gt; (since these two spells have levels that add up to 9). If a spell appears on different spell lists at different levels, use the lowest level-&lt;i&gt;control water&lt;/i&gt;, for example, counts as a 4th-level spell even though it&apos;s a 6th-level spell for sorcerers and wizards. This list need not be exhaustive; at the GM&apos;s discretion, this list may be expanded to include similar spells from other sources or similarly themed effects that do not mimic specific spells. This version of the spell has a casting time of 1 round and lasts for 1 hour per caster level or until its effects are expended.  &lt;b&gt;Shape Realm&lt;/b&gt;: This functions similarly to &lt;i&gt;create&lt;/i&gt; demiplaneUM, except that it alters an equivalent area of the plane the caster is on rather than creating a self-contained realm on the Astral or Ethereal Plane. You cannot grant the affected area an alignment or essence trait opposed by the plane&apos;s traits (such as granting the lawful-aligned trait to a portion of Elysium), and the area is not self-contained. At the GM&apos;s discretion, additional restrictions beyond those listed in the &lt;i&gt;create&lt;/i&gt; demiplane spell may limit this spell&apos;s effects, and additional options for customizing the affected area may be available. This version of the spell has a casting time of 4 hours and lasts for 1 day per caster level. This version of &lt;i&gt;quintessence mastery&lt;/i&gt; can be made permanent in the same way and for the same cost as &lt;i&gt;create&lt;/i&gt; demiplane. This version of &lt;i&gt;quintessence mastery&lt;/i&gt; does not function within the boundaries of a divine realm.&lt;/p&gt;",Planar Adventures,,"Exercise limited control over the quintessence of an Outer Plane, creating or shaping terrain.",2500

This area is stationary and becomes dark and gloomy, reducing the light level by one step (as darkness). Certain spells are enhanced within the area; spells of the &lt;i&gt;shadow&lt;/i&gt; subschool that have reduced effects when disbelieved (such as &lt;i&gt;shadow&lt;/i&gt; evocation) have their reduced effects increased by 20% (to a maximum of 90%) when determining their effects on targets within the area of &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;shadow&lt;/i&gt; invasion&lt;/i&gt;.  In addition, the rift created by &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;shadow&lt;/i&gt; invasion&lt;/i&gt; has a chance of attracting attention from the other side, and the spell can be inverted to bring these watchers through. When &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;shadow&lt;/i&gt; invasion&lt;/i&gt; is dismissed as a standard action, there is a chance that a single evangelist kyton (&lt;i&gt;Pathfinder RPG Bestiary&lt;/i&gt; 185) will be summoned under the caster&apos;s command (as per &lt;i&gt;summon monster&lt;/i&gt; V). This chance is 5% for every full round that &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;shadow&lt;/i&gt; invasion&lt;/i&gt; was active. If the caster level of &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;shadow&lt;/i&gt; invasion&lt;/i&gt; is 16th or greater, this effect summons an interlocutorB3 kyton instead. A kyton summoned this way remains for a number of rounds equal to what the remaining duration of &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;shadow&lt;/i&gt; invasion&lt;/i&gt; would have been had it not been dismissed.

If the soul has not yet been judged and moved on to its final reward or punishment, &lt;i&gt;soulseeker&lt;/i&gt; provides an estimate of its location; in most cases, this is somewhere in the River of Souls or the Boneyard. While this may assist in physically traveling to the soul&apos;s location, especially in cases involving effects such as &lt;i&gt;soul bind&lt;/i&gt; or a devourer&apos;s devour soul ability, the spell&apos;s primary purpose is to identify how long the subject has been dead (and what form of life-restoring magic is necessary). If the soul has already been judged, &lt;i&gt;soulseeker&lt;/i&gt; instead identifies the plane to which the soul has been sent as a petitioner and the petitioner&apos;s general location on that plane (such as Elysium, beneath the boughs of the Witchwood).

When casting mage&apos;s evasion, you must specify the locale and detail up to six specific conditions that trigger this spell. When any of these conditions occurs, your body, mind, and soul are transported to the target destination. The location can be any place you have familiarity (studied carefully, as defined by the teleport spell), even another plane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When casting the spell, you cast greater teleport and possibly other spells that take effect when you arrive at your destination point. The 10 minute casting time is the minimum total for all spells cast (if the companion spells have combined times longer than 10 minutes, use the combined casting times instead). In addition to any material components required by the companion spells, the initial casting of mage&apos;s evasion drains 1d6 hp from the spellcaster. These hit points are stored in the spell, and may be regained by the caster normally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stored hit points are immediately recovered by the caster upon the triggering of the evasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The greater teleport aspect of this spell takes you to your destination, so any condition that prevents teleporting also prevents mage&apos;s evasion. Once reaching the destination point, the companion spells included in the evasion instantly and simultaneously take effect. The companion spells must be ones that have a range of personal and be of a spell level no higher than one-third of your caster level. The total combined level of companion spells may not exceed your caster level. The conditions you specify to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general in nature (see the contingency spell, in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook for guidelines).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spell pulls together your mind, body, and soul if they have been separated. For example, if your soul is trapped in a magic jar when the evasion is triggered, your soul returns to your body (breaking the magic jar spell).If your body or soul has been bound (for example, with a binding, imprisonment, or trap the soul spell), you must succeed at a opposed caster level check (DC 11 + the caster level of the person who cast the trapping spell) to break free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may only use one mage&apos;s evasion spell at a time; if a second is cast, or if a contingency spell is cast, the first spell (if still active) is dispelled.&lt;/p&gt;",Rappan Athuk,,,5000

It also allows a sealed door to be locked or picked if it could not be before. Locking or unlocking such a door requires a successful Disable Device check with a DC equal to the barrier&apos;s break DC + 10. Enlarging an existing keyhole allows viewers to peer through to whatever lies beyond, even if the preexisting keyhole did not allow it, and it reduces the Disable Device DC to open or lock the door by 5.

When traveling the otherworldly paths of the &lt;i&gt;Dead Roads&lt;/i&gt;, you move at a speed of 50 miles per hour regardless of the terrain on the Material Plane. Your own movement speed does not change; you simply arrive at distant destinations more quickly because the &lt;i&gt;Dead Roads&lt;/i&gt; offer a shorter route. You can exit the &lt;i&gt;Dead Roads&lt;/i&gt; at any point before reaching your destination by wandering off the path, in which case you are usually returned to your starting place.

Each targeted creature must currently have at least half its hit points. If at any time during the duration of the spell a target is brought below half her maximum hit points, that target can end the spell on herself as an immediate action to absorb strength from her replica and immediately regain a number of hit points equal to 1d8 plus 1 point per caster level (maximum +25).&lt;/p&gt;",Plane-Hopper&apos;s Handbook,,,NULL

You can fire one ray, plus one additional ray for every 4 levels beyond 3rd (to a maximum of three rays at 11th level). Each ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and can target only a construct or an object. If a ray hits, the target begins to crumble, taking 2d6 points of damage. This damage ignores hardness and damage reduction.&lt;/p&gt;",Plane-Hopper&apos;s Handbook,,,NULL

A creature attempting to move through one of the pillars must attempt a Will save. Failure means the creature can&apos;t move through the pillar and can&apos;t take any other actions for the duration of its turn that round, but it can attempt to pass through the pillar again in subsequent rounds (attempting another save against the effect). A creature need only succeed at one saving throw to move through all pillars created by this spell.  A creature standing within the area of a pillar is dazzled (no save), while a creature making a ranged attack that passes through one or more of the illusory pillars takes a 50% miss chance. A creature can make a melee attack against a target within a pillar at no penalty.&lt;/p&gt;",Distant Realms,,,NULL
Scintillating Wall,illusion,pattern,mind-affecting,"bard 4, psychic 5, sorcerer/wizard 5",1 standard action,"V, S, M (a handful of crushed d&apos;ziriak chitin)",close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels),,wall with an area of up to one 10-ft. square/level,,1 round/level (D),see text,no,"&lt;p&gt;You create a vibrant wall of hypnotic light and color. The wall does not impede movement or line of sight in any way. Creatures moving through the wall must succeed at a Will save or become fascinated. Each round, on its turn, a fascinated creature can attempt a new saving throw to end the effect as a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A creature that succeeds at the save against the fascination effect is no longer affected if it remains within the wall, but it must attempt a new saving throw if it leaves the area and later moves through the wall again. Creatures adjacent to the wall and creatures moving through the wall that succeed at their save against fascination are dazzled.  If you create the wall so that it appears in the same space as one or more creatures, each affected creature must succeed at a Fortitude save or become blinded. Creatures that successfully save against the blindness are subject to the fascination effect unless they leave the wall within 1 round of casting the spell.  &lt;i&gt;Scintillating wall&lt;/i&gt; can be made permanent with a &lt;i&gt;permanency&lt;/i&gt; spell cast by a caster of 13th level or higher, at a cost of 12,500 gp.&lt;/p&gt;",Distant Realms,,,NULL
