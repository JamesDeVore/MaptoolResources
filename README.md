# Maptool Resources Library
This is a collection of all kinds of resources for MapTool, the virtual tabletop.

## Macros
Macros are used to automate actions that a player performs during a game. Inside the macros library each macro will have 2 files, the .mtmacro file which can be imported directly into Maptool, and an associated .txt files if you want to simply view the contents of the macro. 
* If you update / edit a macro in a way that would be beneficial for everyone, please update the .txt file as well :)

## Tokens
Tokens are used for a variety of purposes inside Maptool, for NPCs, Player Icons, Scenery, etc.
